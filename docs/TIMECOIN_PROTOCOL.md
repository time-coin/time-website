## 1. Overview

TIME Coin separates **state finality** from **historical checkpointing**:

- **TimeVote Protocol (Transaction Layer):** fast, leaderless, stake-weighted voting that converges on a single winner among conflicting transactions. Progressive TimeProof assembly provides **unified finality** when 67% weight threshold is reached.
- **TimeProof:** Accumulates signed votes during consensus to create an **objectively verifiable artifact** that any node can validate offline. No separate assembly step needed.
- **TimeLock (Block Layer):** deterministic, VRF-sortition checkpoint blocks every 10 minutes. Blocks are **archival** (history + reward events), not the source of transaction finality.

> **Terminology note:** **AVS** means **Active Validator Set** (eligible active masternodes). It is purely a protocol term.

---

## 2. Design Goals and Non‑Goals

### 2.1 Goals
1. **Fast settlement:** typical confirmation < 1s under healthy network conditions.
2. **Leaderless transaction finality:** no global committee rounds for transaction acceptance.
3. **Sybil resistance:** voting influence proportional to stake weight.
4. **Objective verification:** third parties can verify that a transaction reached finality using a compact proof (TimeProof).
5. **Deterministic checkpoint schedule:** blocks every 600s aligned to wall clock.

### 2.2 Non‑Goals
- Deterministic BFT finality for transaction acceptance (TIME Coin uses probabilistic consensus + proofs).
- A single globally agreed mempool set at all times.
- “Blocks finalize transactions”; blocks only archive and distribute rewards.

---

## 3. System Architecture

Two time scales:

```
Real-time (Transactions)
Tx broadcast -> TimeVote (progressive voting) -> TimeProof assembled -> Finalized

Epoch-time (Blocks)
Every 10 minutes -> TimeLock checkpoint block archives finalized txs + rewards
```

---

## 4. Cryptography and Identifiers

### 4.1 Chain ID
All signed objects MUST include `chain_id` to prevent replay across networks.

### 4.2 Hashes
- `Hash256`: 32-byte SHA-256 cryptographic hash.
- `txid = H(serialized_tx)`

### 4.3 Signatures
- `Ed25519` signatures for node identity, heartbeats, attestations, and finality votes.

### 4.4 VRF
- VRF scheme MUST provide `(vrf_output, vrf_proof)` verifiable under a public key.
- VRF input MUST bind to `"TIMECOIN_VRF_V2" || height || prev_block_hash`.

### 4.5 Encrypted Memos
Transactions MAY include an `encrypted_memo` field containing an ECDH-encrypted message readable only by the sender and recipient.

**Key conversion:**
- Ed25519 signing key → X25519 static secret via `SHA-512(seed)[0..32]` (same scalar as Ed25519)
- Ed25519 public key → X25519 public key via Edwards-to-Montgomery birational map

**Encryption:**
1. `shared_secret = X25519(sender_x25519_secret, recipient_x25519_public)`
2. `aes_key = SHA-256(shared_secret || "TIME-memo-v1")` (domain separation)
3. `ciphertext = AES-256-GCM(aes_key, random_nonce, plaintext)`

**Wire format:**
```
[0]       version (0x01)
[1..33]   sender Ed25519 pubkey (32 bytes)
[33..65]  recipient Ed25519 pubkey (32 bytes)
[65..77]  AES-GCM nonce (12 bytes)
[77..]    ciphertext + 16-byte auth tag
```

**Constraints:**
- Plaintext MUST NOT exceed 256 bytes
- Recipient pubkey MUST be known (from prior on-chain transaction signatures)
- If recipient pubkey is unavailable, the transaction MUST be sent without a memo
- Nodes MUST NOT reject transactions based on memo content or presence
- The `encrypted_memo` field is included in `txid` computation

---

## 5. Masternodes, Weight, and Active Validator Set (AVS)

### 5.1 Masternode Identity
A masternode has:
- `mn_id` (derived from pubkey)
- `pubkey`
- `weight w` (tier-derived)
- `vrf_pubkey` (may be same key)

### 5.2 Tier Weights

Each tier has multiple weight types for different protocol functions:

| Tier | Collateral (TIME) | Sampling Weight | Pool Allocation | Voting Power |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Free | 0 | 1 | 8 TIME/block | 0 |
| Bronze | 1,000 | 10 | 14 TIME/block | 1 |
| Silver | 10,000 | 100 | 18 TIME/block | 10 |
| Gold | 100,000 | 1,000 | 25 TIME/block | 100 |

- **Sampling Weight (`w`):** Used for stake-weighted validator selection during TimeVote polling (§7.4) and VRF sortition threshold (§9.2)
- **Pool Allocation:** Each tier has a dedicated reward pool (§10.4). Shared equally among selected nodes within the tier, with fairness rotation for overflow (max 25 per tier per block)
- **Voting Power:** Used for governance. Free tier nodes cannot vote on governance (voting power = 0)

### 5.2.1 Fairness Bonus (Sortition Weight Adjustment)

To prevent higher-tier masternodes from monopolizing block production, a **fairness bonus** is added to each masternode's sampling weight during VRF sortition (§9.2). The bonus increases the longer a masternode goes without producing a block:

```
fairness_bonus = blocks_without_reward / 10
effective_weight = sampling_weight + fairness_bonus
```

| Blocks Without Reward | Fairness Bonus | Free Effective Weight | Bronze Effective Weight |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 10 |
| 50 | 5 | 6 | 15 |
| 100 | 10 | 11 | 20 |
| 200 | 20 | 21 | 30 |
| 500 | 50 | 51 | 60 |

**Key properties:**
- **On-chain verifiable:** All nodes independently scan blockchain history to compute `blocks_without_reward`, preventing local manipulation
- **Additive, not multiplicative:** Prevents Gold tier from getting outsized bonuses
- **Uncapped:** Grows linearly without bound, ensuring even long-idle nodes eventually produce blocks
- **Resets on reward:** Counter returns to 0 when a masternode produces a block and receives a reward
- **Tier crossover:** A Free tier node waiting 200+ blocks (effective weight 21) can outcompete a Bronze node (base weight 10) that recently produced
- **Dual use:** The fairness bonus is also used during VRF sortition (§9.2) to give longer-waiting nodes a better chance at block production

### 5.3 Collateral Enforcement (MUST CHOOSE ONE)
1. **On-chain staking UTXO (RECOMMENDED):** stake locked by a staking script; weight derived from locked amount and tier mapping.
2. **Registry authority:** external registry signs membership updates (not trustless).

This spec assumes **on-chain staking UTXO** unless explicitly configured otherwise.

### 5.4 Active Validator Set (AVS)
Only masternodes in the **AVS** may be:
- sampled for TimeVote queries
- counted for TimeProof weight thresholds
- eligible to produce/compete for TimeLock checkpoint blocks

A masternode is **AVS-active** if:
- It has a valid `SignedHeartbeat` within `HEARTBEAT_TTL` (default 180s), AND
- That heartbeat has ≥ `WITNESS_MIN` attestations (default 3) from distinct AVS-active witnesses.

Nodes MUST maintain and gossip AVS state.

### 5.5 Stake-weighted voting distribution
Validator selection for queries MUST be stake-weighted over AVS:
`P(i) = w_i / Σ_{j∈AVS} w_j`

Validator selection SHOULD be without replacement per poll.

---

## 6. UTXO Model and Transaction Validity

### 6.1 UTXO States (per outpoint)
- `Unspent`
- `Locked { txid, locked_at }` (masternode collateral or local reservation)
- `SpentPending { txid, votes, total_nodes, spent_at }` (in-flight TX with vote tracking)
- `SpentFinalized { txid, finalized_at, votes }` (TX finalized via TimeVote)
- `Archived { txid, block_height, archived_at }` (spent + checkpointed in block)

### 6.2 Transaction Validity Preconditions
A node MUST treat a Tx as **invalid** (and vote `Invalid`) if:
1. Syntax/format invalid
2. Signature/script invalid
3. Any input outpoint is unknown or not `Unspent` locally (or known `Spent/Archived`)
4. Fee < `MIN_FEE`
5. Fails policy limits (size, etc., if enabled)
6. `encrypted_memo` present but plaintext exceeds 256 bytes (if decryptable)

Note: A transaction with an `encrypted_memo` that cannot be decrypted by the validating node MUST still be accepted (the memo may be for a different party).

### 6.3 Conflict Sets
For each input outpoint `o`, define a conflict set `C(o)` containing all txids spending `o`.

Only one txid per outpoint may be Finalized.

---

## 7. TimeVote Protocol Finality

TIME Coin uses stake-weighted repeated voting with progressive proof accumulation. The protocol is defined on **conflict sets** (double spends), while non-conflicting transactions converge trivially.

### 7.1 Parameters
- `k`: sample size (default 20)
- `α`: successful poll threshold (default 14)
- `Q_finality`: finality threshold (67% of AVS weight)
- `POLL_TIMEOUT`: default 200ms
- `MAX_TXS_PER_QUERY`: default 64

### 7.2 Voting Response
When queried about transaction `X`, a validator MUST:

1. Validate transaction per §6
2. Check UTXO availability
3. Check for conflicts with preferred transactions
4. If valid and preferred: **Sign and return `FinalityVote`** with decision=Accept (§8.1)
5. If invalid or conflicting: **Sign and return `FinalityVote`** with decision=Reject (§8.1)

**CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT:** ALL votes MUST be signed, including Reject votes.

**Rationale (Equivocation Attack Prevention):**

Without signatures on Reject votes, the following attack is possible:

```
Attack Scenario (Network Partition):
1. Attacker broadcasts conflicting transactions tx_A and tx_B simultaneously
2. Network temporarily partitions (natural or induced)
3. Partition 1 sees tx_A first → 40% of validators vote Accept (signed)
4. Partition 2 sees tx_B first → 40% of validators vote Accept (signed)
5. Remaining 20% validators see both → vote Reject (unsigned)

Problem: The 20% can CHANGE their votes after partition heals:
- They have no cryptographic commitment to their Reject decision
- Could vote Accept for tx_A after seeing it reached 40%
- Or vote Accept for tx_B after seeing it reached 40%
- Both transactions could appear to reach 67% threshold (equivocation)
```

**With signed Reject votes:**
- Each validator creates cryptographic evidence of voting history
- Cannot later claim to have voted Accept when they voted Reject
- Equivocation becomes provably fraudulent (slashable offense)
- Network converges to single truth despite partitions

**Critical:** Every vote (Accept AND Reject) MUST include a signed `FinalityVote` immediately. This vote contributes to consensus safety.

Responder MUST NOT return `Accept` for two conflicting txs for the same outpoint.

### 7.3 TimeVote State (per txid)
Each node maintains:
- `status[X] ∈ {Seen, Voting, Finalized, Rejected, Archived}`
- `accumulated_votes[X]`: Set of unique `FinalityVote` signatures
- `accumulated_weight[X]`: u64 (sum of validator weights for votes in accumulated_votes)
- `confidence[X]`: consecutive successful polls (for optimization only)
- Per outpoint preference `preferred_txid[o]`

**State Descriptions:**
- **Seen**: Transaction received, pending validation
- **Voting**: Actively collecting signed votes and building TimeProof
- **Finalized**: Accumulated weight ≥ Q_finality, TimeProof complete
- **Rejected**: Invalid or lost conflict resolution
- **Archived**: Included in TimeLock checkpoint

Tie-breakers MUST be deterministic (RECOMMENDED: lowest `txid` wins ties).

### 7.4 Polling Loop (per txid)
For txid `X` in `Voting`:

1. Select `k` masternodes from the AVS (stake-weighted).
2. Send `VoteQuery` including `X` (batched allowed).
3. Collect **signed votes** until timeout.
4. For each new valid `FinalityVote` received:
   - Verify signature and voter eligibility
   - If vote is from a new voter (not already in `accumulated_votes[X]`):
     - Add vote to `accumulated_votes[X]`
     - Add voter's weight to `accumulated_weight[X]`
5. Let `v = count(Accept votes in this round)`.
6. If `v ≥ α`:
   - `confidence[X] += 1`
   - Update `preferred_txid[o]` for each input outpoint `o` (highest accumulated_weight wins).
7. Else:
   - `confidence[X] = 0`
8. **Check Finality:**
   - If `accumulated_weight[X] ≥ Q_finality`:
     - Set `status[X] = Finalized`
     - Assemble TimeProof from `accumulated_votes[X]`
     - Broadcast TimeProof to network
     - Stop polling for `X`

### 7.5 Finality Rule
A node MUST set `status[X] = Finalized` when:
- `accumulated_weight[X] ≥ Q_finality`, AND
- `accumulated_votes[X]` form a valid TimeProof per §8

When `X` reaches `Finalized`, the node MUST:
1. Mark all conflicting transactions for any input outpoint as `Rejected`
2. Broadcast the assembled TimeProof to peers
3. Stop polling for `X`

**There is only ONE finality state.** When a transaction is `Finalized`, it has an objective, verifiable TimeProof that any node can validate.

> **Wallet UX:** Wallets MAY show "Confirming (X% votes)" during `Voting` state for optimistic UX, but MUST clearly indicate that only `Finalized` represents cryptographic finality with TimeProof.
### 7.6 TimeGuard Protocol

The TimeVote Protocol's probabilistic voting can stall under adversarial conditions or network partitions. This section defines a **deterministic fallback mechanism** that guarantees bounded recovery time while preserving the leaderless nature of normal operation.

#### 7.6.1 Stall Detection

A node detects a **liveness stall** for transaction `X` if ALL of the following hold:

1. `status[X] == Voting` for duration `> STALL_TIMEOUT` (default: 30 seconds)
2. `accumulated_weight[X] < Q_finality` (transaction has not reached finality)
3. No conflicting transaction for any input of `X` has reached `Finalized`
4. Transaction `X` is valid per §6 validation rules

**Rationale:** Distinguishes genuine stalls from consensus-resolved conflicts or invalid transactions.

#### 7.6.2 Stall Evidence and Alert Broadcast

When a node detects a stall for transaction `X`:

1. **Assemble Evidence:**
   ```
   TimeGuardAlert {
     chain_id: u32,
     txid: Hash256,
     tx_hash_commitment: Hash256,
     slot_index: u64,              // Current slot when stall detected
     poll_history: Vec<PollResult>, // Last N poll results
     current_confidence: u32,
     stall_duration_ms: u64,
     reporter_mn_id: String,
     reporter_signature: Signature
   }
   
   PollResult {
     round: u64,
     votes_valid: u32,
     votes_invalid: u32,
     votes_unknown: u32,
     timestamp_ms: u64
   }
   ```

2. **Broadcast to Network:**
   - Send `TimeGuardAlert` to all connected peers
   - Peers MUST validate signature and that reporter is in AVS
   - Peers SHOULD relay alert if they also observe the stall

#### 7.6.3 Fallback Trigger Threshold

A node enters **Fallback Mode** for transaction `X` when:

- It receives `TimeGuardAlert` messages from `≥ f+1` distinct masternodes (where `f = ⌊(n-1)/3⌋`)
- All alerts reference the same `txid` and conflict set
- At least `FALLBACK_MIN_DURATION` (default: 20s) has elapsed since first alert

**Safety:** `f+1` alerts guarantees at least one honest node observed the stall (in a BFT-style `n ≥ 3f+1` model).

#### 7.6.4 Deterministic Resolution Round

Upon entering Fallback Mode for transaction `X`:

**Step 1: Freeze TimeVote Polling**
- Set `status[X] = FallbackResolution`
- Stop sending new `VoteQuery` messages for `X` or any conflicting transaction
- Continue responding to queries from peers (based on current preference)

**Step 2: Deterministic Leader Election**
```
fallback_leader = MN with minimum H(txid || slot_index || prev_block_hash || mn_pubkey)
```
- All nodes compute the same leader independently (no message exchange)
- Leader MUST be member of AVS snapshot at `slot_index`
- If elected leader is offline, timeout advances to next slot

**Step 3: Leader Proposal**
Within `FALLBACK_PROPOSAL_TIMEOUT` (default: 5 seconds), the leader broadcasts:
```
FinalityProposal {
  chain_id: u32,
  txid: Hash256,
  tx_hash_commitment: Hash256,
  slot_index: u64,
  decision: Accept | Reject,
  justification: String,  // OPTIONAL: debugging info
  leader_mn_id: String,
  leader_signature: Signature
}
```

**Decision Logic for Leader:**
- `Accept` if `accumulated_weight[X] > accumulated_weight[conflicting_tx]` for all conflicts
- `Reject` if any conflict has higher `accumulated_weight` value
- `Accept` if tied (use deterministic tie-breaker: lowest `txid`)

**Step 4: Voting Round**
All AVS members vote on the proposal within `FALLBACK_VOTE_TIMEOUT` (default: 5 seconds):
```
FallbackVote {
  chain_id: u32,
  proposal_hash: Hash256,  // H(FinalityProposal)
  vote: Approve | Reject,
  voter_mn_id: String,
  voter_weight: u64,
  voter_signature: Signature
}
```

**Voting Rule:**
- `Approve` if voter's local state agrees with leader's decision AND proposal is valid
- `Reject` otherwise

**Step 5: Finalization**
If proposal receives `≥ Q_finality` total weight in `Approve` votes (same threshold as TimeProof §8.3):

1. Set `status[X] = Finalized` (if decision = Accept) or `Rejected` (if decision = Reject)
2. Assemble TimeProof (§8) using the collected `FallbackVote` signatures
3. Mark conflicting transactions as `Rejected`
4. Resume normal TimeVote operation for other transactions

**Step 6: Timeout and Retry**
If no decision after `FALLBACK_ROUND_TIMEOUT` (default: 10 seconds):

1. Increment `slot_index += 1` (advances to next leader)
2. Repeat from Step 2 with new leader
3. After `MAX_FALLBACK_ROUNDS` (default: 5), escalate to TimeLock checkpoint synchronization

#### 7.6.5 TimeLock Checkpoint Synchronization (Ultimate Fallback)

If fallback rounds fail after `MAX_FALLBACK_ROUNDS` attempts:

1. Transaction `X` remains in `Voting` state
2. Wait for next TimeLock block boundary (≤ 10 minutes per §9)
3. TimeLock block producer (VRF-selected) MUST include a `TimeGuardRecoveryFlag` in block header
4. Block producer deterministically resolves all pending liveness stalls:
   - Includes transactions with `accumulated_weight[X] > 0` (at least one positive vote observed)
   - Excludes transactions with only negative votes
5. All nodes synchronize to TimeLock block state
6. Reset TimeVote polling for any remaining unresolved transactions

> **Note:** This is a rare fallback (expected frequency: < 0.01% of transactions under normal operation).

#### 7.6.6 State Transition Diagram

         │                                            (accumulated_weight ≥ Q_finality)
         │                                            (TimeProof complete)

                          (Retry with new leader or TimeLock checkpoint)
```

#### 7.6.7 Protocol Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `STALL_TIMEOUT` | 30s | Duration before declaring liveness stall |
| `FALLBACK_MIN_DURATION` | 20s | Minimum time before accepting alerts |
| `FALLBACK_PROPOSAL_TIMEOUT` | 5s | Leader must propose within this time |
| `FALLBACK_VOTE_TIMEOUT` | 5s | Voting period duration |
| `FALLBACK_ROUND_TIMEOUT` | 10s | Total time for one fallback round |
| `MAX_FALLBACK_ROUNDS` | 5 | Attempts before TimeLock escalation |
| `ALERT_THRESHOLD` | f+1 | TimeGuardAlerts needed to trigger (`f = ⌊(n-1)/3⌋`) |

#### 7.6.8 Security Considerations

**Byzantine Resistance:**
- Fallback requires `f+1` alerts → at least one honest node confirms stall
- Leader is deterministic → no leader election attacks
- Voting requires `≥ Q_finality` weight → Byzantine minority cannot force decision
- TimeLock provides ultimate synchronization point

**Liveness Guarantees:**
- Worst-case resolution time: `30s (stall) + 5×10s (fallback rounds) + 10min (TimeLock) ≈ 11.3 minutes`
- Typical case: `30s (stall) + 10s (single fallback round) = 40 seconds`
- No indefinite deadlock possible (bounded by TimeLock interval)

**Comparison to Pure BFT:**
- Avoids view change storms (deterministic leader selection)
- No multi-phase commit complexity (single propose → vote → finalize)
- Fallback is rare (only after TimeVote stalls)
- Normal operation remains leaderless and fast (<1s)

#### 7.6.9 Implementation Requirements

Nodes MUST implement:
1. Stall detection timer per transaction in `Voting` state
2. `TimeGuardAlert` message handling and relay logic
3. Deterministic leader computation function
4. `FinalityProposal` and `FallbackVote` message types
5. Fallback voting logic and threshold checking
6. State transition from `FallbackResolution` to final state
7. Progressive accumulation of signed votes into `accumulated_votes[X]`
8. Weight tracking in `accumulated_weight[X]`
9. Finality threshold check after each polling round

Nodes SHOULD implement:
1. Metrics for fallback activation frequency
2. Logging of fallback events for network health monitoring
3. Dashboard indicators when node is in fallback mode
4. Optimistic UX indicators showing vote accumulation progress during `Voting` state

## 8. TimeProof (Verifiable Finality)

TimeProof is the mechanism for achieving finality in TimeCoin. A TimeProof is assembled progressively as nodes collect finality votes during normal transaction validation. Once enough votes are collected (≥67% of AVS weight), the transaction achieves finality and the TimeProof can be:
- gossiped
- stored
- included (directly or by hash) in checkpoint blocks
- validated by any node without replaying sampling history

### 8.1 Finality Vote
A **FinalityVote** is a signed statement:

`FinalityVote = { chain_id, txid, tx_hash_commitment, slot_index, decision, voter_mn_id, voter_weight, signature }`

Where:
- `decision ∈ {Accept, Reject}` - REQUIRED: The voter's decision on this transaction
- `tx_hash_commitment = H(canonical_tx_bytes)` (canonical serialization MUST be specified)
- `slot_index` is the slot when the vote is issued (prevents indefinite replay)

Signature covers all fields including the `decision`.

**Eligibility:** A vote counts only if the voter is AVS-active in the referenced `slot_index` (see §8.4).

**Security Note:** Both Accept AND Reject votes MUST be signed to prevent equivocation attacks (see §7.2). A validator who signs "Reject" for transaction X creates cryptographic proof they rejected it, preventing them from later claiming they voted "Accept" during network partitions.

### 8.2 TimeProof Definition
A **TimeProof** for transaction `X` is:

`TimeProof(X) = { tx, slot_index, votes[] }`

Where `votes[]` contains ONLY votes with `decision=Accept`.

Validity conditions:
1. All `votes[]` signatures verify.
2. All votes agree on `(chain_id, txid, tx_hash_commitment, slot_index)`.
3. **All votes have `decision=Accept`** (Reject votes are signed but do NOT contribute to finality weight).
4. Voters are distinct (by `voter_mn_id`).
5. Each voter is a member of the **AVS snapshot** for that `slot_index`.
6. Sum of distinct voter weights `Σ w_i ≥ Q_finality(slot_index)`.

**Note on Reject Votes:**
- Reject votes MUST be signed (equivocation prevention per §7.2)
- Reject votes create cryptographic proof of rejection
- Reject votes do NOT count toward the 67% finality threshold
- Only Accept votes accumulate toward TimeProof finality weight

### 8.3 Finality threshold
Let `total_AVS_weight(slot_index)` be the total weight of the AVS at that slot.

Default:
- `Q_finality(slot_index) = 0.51 * total_AVS_weight(slot_index)` (rounded up)

The network MUST use a single, agreed rounding rule.

### 8.4 AVS snapshots
Nodes MUST retain **AVS snapshots** by slot for at least `ASS_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` slots (rename retained for historical compatibility; see defaults).

An AVS snapshot MUST include:
- member `mn_id`
- `pubkey`
- `weight`
- (optional) `vrf_pubkey`

### 8.5 Assembling a TimeProof
TimeProof is assembled progressively during normal transaction validation:
- When performing `SampleQuery` during validation, responders SHOULD include a `FinalityVote` when responding `Valid` (if requested).
- The initiator accumulates unique votes as part of the normal polling process.
- Once the accumulated vote weight reaches the finality threshold (≥67% of AVS weight), the TimeProof is complete and the transaction achieves finality.

There is no separate "finalization phase" - votes are collected during the same process as validation polling.

### 8.6 Finalization Rule
A node MUST set `status[X] = Finalized` when it has a valid `TimeProof(X)`.

Once a transaction is `Finalized`, a node MUST reject any conflicting transaction `Y` spending any same outpoint.

The TimeProof IS the finality - there is only one finality state, achieved when the vote threshold is met.

### 8.7 Catastrophic conflict
If two conflicting transactions both obtain valid TimeProofs, the network’s safety assumptions have been violated. Clients SHOULD halt automatic finalization and surface an emergency condition. (Slashing/recovery is out of scope unless separately specified.)

---

## 9. TimeLock Checkpoint Blocks (Archival Chain)

Checkpoint blocks exist to:
- checkpoint history
- provide a reward schedule
- compactly summarize finalized transactions

### 9.1 Slot Timing
- `BLOCK_INTERVAL = 600s`
- `slot_time = slot_index * 600`

### 9.2 Sortition (VRF-based Self-Selection)

Each masternode `i` in the AVS independently evaluates whether it is eligible to propose a block:

1. Compute VRF:
   - `vrf_input = SHA256("TIMECOIN_VRF_V2" || uint64_le(height) || prev_block_hash)`
   - `(vrf_output_i, vrf_proof_i) = VRF(vrf_input, sk_i)`
   - `score_i = uint64_le(vrf_output_i[0..8])`

2. Compute effective weight with fairness bonus (§5.2.1):
   - `effective_weight_i = sampling_weight_i + blocks_without_reward_i / 10`
   - `total_effective_weight = Σ effective_weight_j` for all `j ∈ AVS`

3. Check eligibility threshold:
   - `threshold_i = (effective_weight_i / total_effective_weight) × TARGET_PROPOSERS × 2^64`
   - `TARGET_PROPOSERS = 1` (targets exactly one proposer per slot to minimize competing blocks)
   - Node is eligible if `score_i < threshold_i`

4. If eligible, broadcast `TimeLockBlockProposal` containing the block with `vrf_proof`, `vrf_output`, and `vrf_score` in the header.

Lower `score_i` is better. Among multiple valid proposals, the one with the lowest `vrf_score` is selected as canonical (§9.3).

**Properties:**
- **Private selection:** Only the selected node knows it is eligible until it reveals the VRF proof (DDoS resistant)
- **Verifiable:** Any node can verify the VRF proof using the proposer's public key
- **Fair:** Fairness bonus ensures all tiers eventually produce blocks
- **Tight selection:** TARGET_PROPOSERS=1 ensures ~67% probability of exactly one proposer per slot with 6 equal-weight nodes; empty slots are resolved by the timeout fallback below

**Timeout Fallback (Deadlock Recovery):**
If no valid proposal is received within **5 seconds** of **wall-clock wait time** at the current height, nodes progressively relax the threshold by multiplying `effective_weight_i` by `2^attempt` (where attempt increments every 5 s of real waiting). This uses actual elapsed time since the node started waiting for a given height, NOT time since the slot was scheduled — preventing all nodes from being immediately eligible during catch-up scenarios. After ~10 seconds of deadlock, probability of at least one proposer exceeds 99.9%. Free-tier nodes require **15 s of deadlock (attempt ≥ 3)** before receiving any VRF boost, maintaining sybil resistance.

**Catch-up Acceleration:**
When a node detects it is **more than 50 blocks behind** the network tip (`blocks_behind > 50`), `leader_attempt` is initialized to 1 (pre-boost) instead of 0. This causes paid-tier nodes to skip the strict first VRF cycle immediately, allowing faster block production from available leaders during bulk synchronization.

**Security Note (VRF Grinding Mitigation):**
The VRF input MUST include `prev_block_hash` to prevent grinding attacks. The domain separator `"TIMECOIN_VRF_V2"` and block `height` are predictable, but `prev_block_hash` changes with each block and cannot be known in advance, making pre-computation attacks infeasible. This follows best practices from Algorand, Ethereum 2.0, and Cardano.

### 9.3 Canonical Block Selection

Any VRF-eligible masternode MAY publish a candidate block for the slot.

Nodes select the canonical block for a slot by:
1. Validity first (VRF proof verifies, proposer in AVS, score below threshold)
2. Lowest `vrf_score` second
3. Tie-breaker: lowest block hash

When a node receives a valid proposal with a lower VRF score than a previously received proposal at the same height, it switches its vote to the better proposal.

### 9.4 Block Content
A block MUST contain:
- Header:
  - `version: u32`
  - `height: u64`
  - `previous_hash: Hash256`
  - `merkle_root: Hash256` (Merkle root over transactions)
  - `timestamp: i64`
  - `block_reward: u64`
  - `leader: String` (block producer identity)
  - `attestation_root: Hash256`
  - `masternode_tiers: MasternodeTierCounts`
  - `vrf_proof: Vec<u8>`, `vrf_output: Hash256`, `vrf_score: u64`
  - `active_masternodes_bitmap: Vec<u8>`
  - `liveness_recovery: Option<bool>` (TimeGuard recovery flag)
- Body:
  - `transactions: Vec<Transaction>` (full transaction data)
  - `masternode_rewards: Vec<(String, u64)>` (reward allocations)
  - `time_attestations: Vec<TimeAttestation>`
  - `consensus_participants_bitmap: Vec<u8>` — **direct voters (TimeVote prepare/precommit) MERGED with gossip-active masternodes**. Inclusion in this bitmap is the gateway to tier-pool rewards and VRF eligibility in the next block. Gossip-active nodes are included to ensure pyramid-topology peers not directly connected to the producer remain reward-eligible. Anti-gaming: gossip requires ~30–60 s to accumulate, preventing mid-block joiners from qualifying.

**Reward eligibility chain:** gossip sighting or direct vote → present in `consensus_participants_bitmap` in block N → eligible for rewards in block N+1. Nodes joining less than one gossip cycle before block production do not receive rewards until the following block.

Blocks include full transactions (not hashes/entries) so syncing nodes can reconstruct UTXO state. Transactions are sorted lexicographically by `txid`.

### 9.5 Block Validity
A node MUST accept a block only if:
1. `previous_hash` matches the current canonical chain tip.
2. VRF proof verifies and binds to `(previous_hash, height, chain_id)`.
3. Transactions are valid and unique by txid.
4. No two included transactions conflict (no outpoint is spent twice).
5. All included transactions pass base validity checks.
6. Merkle root is correctly computed from included transactions.

### 9.5.1 Two-Phase Commit (Block Consensus)

In addition to VRF sortition, blocks achieve consensus via a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol among validators:

**Phase 1: Prepare**
1. Leader assembles and broadcasts `TimeLockBlockProposal { block }`
2. Validators verify: valid transactions, correct previous hash, valid merkle root, valid VRF proof
3. Validators send `TimeVotePrepare { block_hash, voter_id, signature }` (Ed25519 over `block_hash + voter_id + "PREPARE"`)
4. Threshold: >50% of participating validator count

**Phase 2: Precommit**
1. After prepare threshold met, validators send `TimeVotePrecommit { block_hash, voter_id, signature }` (Ed25519 over `block_hash + voter_id + "PRECOMMIT"`)
2. Threshold: >50% of participating validator count
3. Block is finalized after precommit threshold is met

**Small Network Fallback:** If validator count < 3, blocks are added directly without 2PC (development/bootstrap mode).

**Note:** Block 2PC uses validator **count** majority, distinct from transaction finality which uses **weighted stake** majority (§8.3).

### 9.6 Archival transition
Upon block acceptance:
- Each included tx becomes `Archived`.
- UTXO updates are applied from the transaction content.
- Rewards are applied according to §10.

---

## 10. Rewards and Fees

### 10.1 Reward event
Rewards are created per checkpoint block.

### 10.2 Base reward
`R = 100 TIME` (fixed per block, 10,000,000,000 satoshis)

The base reward is a constant 100 TIME per checkpoint block, providing predictable issuance and simplifying consensus (all nodes compute identical rewards without needing to agree on AVS size).

### 10.3 Fee accounting
Fees are the sum of included archived transactions’ fees for the slot.

### 10.4 Payout split

The distribution mode depends on whether any paid-tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold) masternodes are active.

---

**Mode A — Tier-Based Distribution** (at least one paid-tier node present):

```
Total Reward = 100 TIME + transaction_fees

Distribution:
   5 TIME → Treasury (on-chain governance fund)
  30 TIME + transaction_fees → Block Producer (VRF-selected proposer)
  65 TIME → Four independent tier pools:
    Gold pool:   25 TIME — shared equally among active Gold masternodes
    Silver pool: 18 TIME — shared equally among active Silver masternodes
    Bronze pool: 14 TIME — shared equally among active Bronze masternodes
    Free pool:    8 TIME — shared equally among active Free masternodes

The block producer also receives a tier pool share (merged into their output).
Their total = leader_bonus + tier_pool_share.
If a tier has no active nodes, its pool goes to the block producer.
```

---

**Mode B — All-Free Distribution** (no paid-tier nodes present):

```
Total Reward = 100 TIME + transaction_fees

Distribution:
   5 TIME → Treasury (on-chain governance fund)
  95 TIME + transaction_fees → Free pool, split equally among up to 25
             eligible Free nodes (sorted by fairness bonus, longest-waiting first)

There is no separate producer/leader bonus in this mode. The block producer
is simply one of the Free nodes sharing the pool.
```

---

**Rotation via Fairness Bonus:**

When a tier has more active nodes than `MAX_TIER_RECIPIENTS` (25), nodes are selected by fairness bonus (longest without reward first). Within the selected set, each node receives an equal share of their tier's pool. Excluded nodes rotate in on subsequent blocks.

```
fairness_bonus = blocks_without_pool_reward / 10
Selection: sort by fairness_bonus DESC, then address ASC (deterministic tiebreak)
Take top 25 per tier → distribute tier_pool / recipient_count equally
```

There is no minimum per-node payout threshold — any share amount, however small, is a valid reward output.

Payout MUST be represented as one or more on-chain reward transactions included in the checkpoint block (coinbase-style).

**Example Distribution — Tier-Based (8 masternodes: 2 Gold, 1 Silver, 2 Bronze, 3 Free):**
```
Block producer: Bronze node A (won VRF sortition)

Treasury: 5 TIME
Leader bonus: 30 TIME + fees

Gold pool (25 TIME ÷ 2 nodes):
- Gold node A:   12.5 TIME
- Gold node B:   12.5 TIME

Silver pool (18 TIME ÷ 1 node):
- Silver node A: 18 TIME

Bronze pool (14 TIME ÷ 2 nodes):
- Bronze node A: 7 TIME (producer — merged with leader bonus = 37 TIME + fees)
- Bronze node B: 7 TIME

Free pool (8 TIME ÷ 3 nodes):
- Free node A:   2.67 TIME
- Free node B:   2.67 TIME
- Free node C:   2.66 TIME (remainder)
```

**Example Distribution — All-Free (5 Free nodes, no paid tier):**
```
Block producer: Free node C (won VRF sortition)

Treasury: 5 TIME
Free pool (95 TIME ÷ 5 nodes, sorted by fairness bonus):
- Free node A:   19 TIME  (waiting longest)
- Free node B:   19 TIME
- Free node C:   19 TIME  (producer — no separate leader bonus)
- Free node D:   19 TIME
- Free node E:   19 TIME
```

## 11. Network Protocol

### 11.1 Message Types (Wire)

The `NetworkMessage` enum defines all P2P wire messages. Key consensus-related categories shown below (73 total variants in code):

```rust
pub enum NetworkMessage {
    // --- Transactions ---
    TransactionBroadcast(Transaction),
    TransactionFinalized { txid: Hash256, tx: Transaction },
    GetPendingTransactions,
    PendingTransactionsResponse(Vec<Transaction>),

    // --- TimeVote Protocol (transaction finality) ---
    TimeVoteRequest { txid: Hash256, tx_hash_commitment: Hash256, slot_index: u64, tx: Option<Transaction> },
    TimeVoteResponse { vote: TimeVote },
    TimeVoteBroadcast { vote: TimeVote },
    TimeProofBroadcast { proof: TimeProof },

    // --- Finality Voting ---
    FinalityVoteRequest { txid: Hash256, slot_index: u64 },
    FinalityVoteResponse { vote: FinalityVote },
    FinalityVoteBroadcast { vote: FinalityVote },

    // --- TimeLock Block Production (2PC) ---
    TimeLockBlockProposal { block: Block },
    TimeVotePrepare { block_hash: Hash256, voter_id: String, signature: Vec<u8> },
    TimeVotePrecommit { block_hash: Hash256, voter_id: String, signature: Vec<u8> },

    // --- Block Sync ---
    BlockAnnouncement(Block),
    GetBlocks(u64, u64),
    BlocksResponse(Vec<Block>),
    GetBlockHeight,
    BlockHeightResponse(u64),

    // --- Peer Exchange ---
    GetPeers,
    PeersResponse(Vec<PeerExchangeEntry>),  // includes connection_count, is_masternode, tier
    Ping { nonce: u64, timestamp: i64, height: Option<u64> },
    Pong { nonce: u64, timestamp: i64, height: Option<u64> },

    // --- UTXO State ---
    UTXOStateQuery(Vec<OutPoint>),
    UTXOStateResponse(Vec<(OutPoint, UTXOState)>),
    UTXOStateNotification(UTXOStateChange),

    // --- Masternodes ---
    MasternodeAnnouncement { address, reward_address, tier, public_key },
    GetMasternodes,
    MasternodesResponse(Vec<MasternodeAnnouncementData>),

    // --- Liveness & Fork Resolution ---
    LivenessAlert { alert: LivenessAlert },
    FinalityProposal { proposal: FinalityProposal },
    FallbackVote { vote: FallbackVote },
    ForkAlert { your_height, your_hash, consensus_height, consensus_hash, ... },

    // ... plus handshake, version, genesis, subscription, and chain-work variants
}
```

**CRITICAL CHANGE (Security Enhancement):**

Previously, `finality_vote` was `Option<FinalityVote>` and only included for Valid votes. This created an equivocation vulnerability where validators could change their Reject votes after network partitions.

**New Requirement:** `finality_vote` is REQUIRED for ALL responses (Valid, Invalid, Unknown):
- `Valid` → `FinalityVote { decision: Accept, ... }`
- `Invalid` → `FinalityVote { decision: Reject, ... }`
- `Unknown` → `FinalityVote { decision: Reject, ... }` (conservative: unknown = unsafe)

### 11.2 Anti-replay / validation
All signed messages MUST include `chain_id` and a time/slot domain separator.

Nodes SHOULD rate-limit:
- polling requests per peer
- TimeProof payload sizes
- transaction relay

---

## 12. Mempool and Pooling Rules

### 12.1 Pools
The `TransactionPool` uses a DashMap-based design with three concurrent maps:
- **`pending`** (`DashMap<Hash256, Transaction>`): Unfinalized transactions (covers Seen, Voting, and FallbackResolution states)
- **`finalized`** (`DashMap<Hash256, Transaction>`): Transactions with TimeProof (awaiting block inclusion)
- **`rejected`** (`DashMap<Hash256, Transaction>`): Transactions that failed validation or consensus

Pressure levels (by pending pool size relative to `MAX_MEMPOOL_SIZE = 100 MB`):
- **Normal** (< 50%): Accept all valid transactions
- **Warning** (50–75%): Log warnings, continue accepting
- **Critical** (75–90%): Reject low-priority transactions
- **Emergency** (> 90%): Reject all new transactions

### 12.2 Checkpoint inclusion eligibility
Checkpoint blocks SHOULD include:
- all `finalized` pool transactions not yet archived,
- subject to size limits.

Blocks MUST only include transactions with TimeProof. When a block is added, only the specific included transactions are removed from the finalized pool (not a full clear).

---

## 13. Security Model

### 13.1 Assumptions
- A majority (by weight) of the AVS is honest (parameter-dependent).
- Network connectivity allows representative voting.
- AVS membership/weights are correctly enforced (staking/registry + heartbeats + witnesses).

### 13.2 Safety
- Transaction finality is objective once a TimeProof with threshold weight (≥67% of AVS) is obtained.
- The TimeProof mechanism ensures that conflicting transactions cannot both achieve finality under honest majority assumptions.

### 13.3 Liveness
If honest weight dominates and the network is connected, honest transactions can gather TimeProof signatures and be checkpointed.

---

## 14. Configuration Defaults

- `BLOCK_INTERVAL = 600s`
- `TIMEVOTE_K = 20` (sample size)
- `TIMEVOTE_ALPHA = 14` (quorum threshold)
- `Q_FINALITY = 0.51 * total_AVS_weight(slot_index)` (finality threshold)
- `HEARTBEAT_PERIOD = 60s`
- `HEARTBEAT_TTL = 180s`
- `WITNESS_MIN = 3`
- `POLL_TIMEOUT = 200ms`
- `MAX_TXS_PER_QUERY = 64`
- `MIN_FEE = 0.001 TIME`
- `AVS_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION = 7 days worth of slots` (RECOMMENDED; exact number depends on `BLOCK_INTERVAL`)

---

## 15. Implementation Notes

1. **AVS Snapshotting:** store AVS membership/weights by slot for verifying TimeProof voter eligibility.
2. **Bandwidth:** TimeProofs can be large; prefer `timeproof_hash` in blocks + fetch-on-demand.
3. **Conflict handling:** treat conflicts per outpoint; when a TimeProof is accepted, prune all competing spends.
4. **Archival chain reorg tolerance:** checkpoint blocks are archival; transaction finality comes from TimeProof. Reorgs should not affect finalized state unless you explicitly couple rewards/state to block order.
5. **Canonical TX serialization:** MUST be specified precisely, since `tx_hash_commitment` is signed. (Do not reuse non-canonical encodings.)

---

## 16. Cryptographic Bindings (NORMATIVE ADDITIONS)

### 16.1 Hash Function
**REQUIREMENT:** All cryptographic hashing uses SHA-256.

```
HASH_FUNCTION = SHA-256
```

**Usage:** All cryptographic hashes (`txid`, `block_hash`, `merkle_root`, `tx_hash_commitment`, VRF input binding) MUST use SHA-256 consistently across all nodes.

**Why SHA-256?**
SHA-256 provides universal compatibility with the Ed25519/ECVRF cryptographic suite (both SHA-family based), broad hardware acceleration support, and well-understood security properties. A single hash function simplifies consensus rules and eliminates algorithm mismatch risks.

See **CRYPTOGRAPHY_RATIONALE.md** for detailed explanation.

### 16.2 VRF Scheme
**REQUIREMENT:** VRF is used in §9 for TimeLock sortition. The specification MUST pin a concrete VRF construction:

```
VRF_SCHEME = ECVRF-EDWARDS25519-SHA512-TAI (RFC 9381)
Alternative: deterministic construction from Ed25519 private key
```

**Properties:**
- Deterministic output given the same input (same privkey + input = same score)
- Publicly verifiable proof from public key (anyone can verify)
- Unpredictable to adversaries (only privkey holder knows score first)
- Rankable (numeric output allows sorting; lowest wins)

**Input binding (§9.2):**
```
vrf_input = SHA256("TIMECOIN_VRF_V2" || uint64_le(height) || prev_block_hash)
(vrf_output, vrf_proof) = VRF_Prove(vrf_sk, vrf_input)
```

**CRITICAL: VRF Grinding Attack Prevention**

The VRF input components are:

1. **`"TIMECOIN_VRF_V2"`** - Domain separator string (version-tagged for security enhancements)
2. **`height`** - Block height (deterministic, little-endian u64)
3. **`prev_block_hash`** - Provides unpredictable entropy that changes with each block

**Why this ordering matters:**

Without `prev_block_hash`, an attacker with many potential masternode keys could:
```
For each candidate_key in [key_1, ..., key_N]:
    For each future_slot in [t+1, t+2, ..., t+1000]:
        vrf_score = VRF(candidate_key, future_slot)
        if vrf_score wins:
            register this key as masternode
```

This allows selective registration of only "winning" keys, centralizing block production.

**With `prev_block_hash`:**
- Attacker cannot compute VRF(slot_t+2) until block_t+1 is produced
- Block hashes depend on transaction content (unpredictable)
- Pre-computation beyond 1 block ahead is cryptographically infeasible
- Fair competition among all registered masternodes

This mitigation follows proven approaches from:
- **Algorand:** Uses previous block hash in VRF sortition
- **Ethereum 2.0:** Uses RANDAO (previous block randomness) 
- **Cardano (Ouroboros Praos):** Uses epoch nonce from prior blocks

**Implementation Version:** TIMECOIN_VRF_V2 (grinding-resistant)

**Why VRF (not Ed25519 or SHA-256 alone)?**  
- Ed25519 signatures cannot be ranked (are just bytes, not sortition-ready)
- SHA-256 hashes are predictable to everyone (no privacy advantage from a privkey)
- VRF combines: deterministic output + unpredictability + verifiability + rankability

See **CRYPTOGRAPHY_RATIONALE.md** for detailed comparison.

### 16.3 Canonical Transaction Serialization
**REQUIREMENT:** Transaction serialization MUST be fully specified, as `tx_hash_commitment` (§8.1) is signed in finality votes.

**Format:**
```
TxSerialization = {
  version: u32_le,
  input_count: varint,
  inputs: TxInput[],
  output_count: varint,
  outputs: TxOutput[],
  lock_time: u64_le,
}

TxInput = {
  prev_txid: Hash256 (big-endian),
  prev_index: u32_le,
  script_length: varint,
  script: bytes[],
}

TxOutput = {
  value: u64_le,
  script_length: varint,
  script: bytes[],
}

varint = variable-length integer (little-endian, 1-9 bytes)
```

**Rules:**
- Fields MUST be serialized in the above order.
- No padding or alignment bytes.
- Arrays ordered as specified; no reordering.
- Hash computed as `txid = SHA256(canonical_bytes)`.

---

## 17. Transaction and Staking UTXO Details

### 17.1 Transaction Format
**Wire format:** See §16.3. This section elaborates on script semantics.

### 17.2 Staking UTXO Script System (NORMATIVE)
§5.3 references "on-chain staking UTXO" but requires detailed script semantics for implementation.

**Staking Output Script (Lock Script):**
```
OP_STAKE <tier_id: u8> <pubkey: 33 bytes> <unlock_height: u32> <op_unlock: 1 byte>
```

**Semantics:**
- `tier_id`: maps to tier weights (§5.2)
- `pubkey`: node's Ed25519 public key (masternode identity)
- `unlock_height`: earliest checkpoint block height at which stake can be withdrawn
- `op_unlock`: control byte for future extension

**Unlock/Withdrawal (Unlock Script):**
```
<signature: Ed25519Sig> <unlock_witness: bytes>
```

Must satisfy:
1. Signature from `pubkey` is valid over the spending transaction
2. Current checkpoint block height ≥ `unlock_height`

**Stake Maturation:**
- A staking output is **mature** once included in a checkpoint block.
- A masternode may only join the AVS after stake maturity.
- Weight corresponds to the locked amount's tier (§5.2).

**Tier Changes:**
- Require a new staking output to be created
- Old stake must be withdrawn before new stake becomes active
- AVS membership transitions enforce via heartbeat attestation grace period

### 17.3 Regular Transaction Outputs (Non-Staking)
```
<value: u64_le> <lock_script>

lock_script = {
  OP_CHECKSIG <pubkey_hash: 20 bytes>
  |
  OP_MULTISIG <m: u8> <pubkey1> ... <pubkeyn> <n: u8>
  |
  OP_RETURN <data: bytes> (unspendable)
}
```

---

## 18. Network Transport Layer (NORMATIVE)

### 18.1 Transport Protocol
**REQUIREMENT:** Specify the transport medium for §11 messages.

```
TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL = TCP (currently unencrypted)
Encryption: TLS v1.3 support (infrastructure ready, integration pending)
Development: Plain TCP for simplicity and debugging
```

**Current Implementation:**
- Raw TCP via `tokio::net::TcpStream`
- No transport-layer encryption (v1.0.0)
- TLS infrastructure exists in `src/network/secure_transport.rs` and `src/network/tls.rs`
- Future versions will integrate TLS encryption

**Justification:**
- TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery with universal compatibility
- Simpler debugging during initial deployment
- TLS v1.3 support ready for future integration
- Focus on protocol correctness before adding encryption overhead

**Security Note:**
- Current P2P communication is **not encrypted**
- Deploy nodes on trusted networks or use VPN/SSH tunneling
- Message-level signing provides authentication (even without encryption)
- TLS integration planned for v1.1.0

### 18.2 Message Framing
All messages MUST be length-prefixed:

```
Frame = {
  length: u32_be (network byte order, excludes this field),
  message_type: u8,
  payload: bytes[length - 1],
}
```

**Max message size:** `4 MB`  
**Connection limits:** `MAX_PEERS = 50` (configurable, inbound + outbound)

### 18.3 Serialization Format
**REQUIREMENT:** Pin message serialization.

```
SERIALIZATION_FORMAT = bincode v1.0 (or protobuf v3 for external APIs)
- bincode: compact, deterministic, suitable for internal wire protocol
- protobuf: forward-compatible, suitable for stable RPC APIs
```

Implementations MUST define a mapping from §11 Rust enums to wire bytes.

### 18.4 Peer Discovery and Bootstrap
**Bootstrap Process:**
1. Node reads hardcoded bootstrap peer list (DNS seeds or IP addresses).
2. Connects to bootstrap peers via TCP (with optional TLS).
3. Requests `PeerListRequest` to discover additional peers.
4. Maintains peer database; prefer geographic diversity and low latency.

**DNS Seeds (REQUIRED for mainnet):**
```
seed1.timecoin.dev
seed2.timecoin.dev
seed3.timecoin.dev
```

(To be populated by network operators.)

**Message Type:**
```rust
PeerListRequest { limit: u16 },
PeerListResponse { peers: Vec<PeerInfo> },

pub struct PeerInfo {
    pub addr: IpAddr,
    pub port: u16,
    pub services: u32,  // bitmap: validator, full_node, light_client
}
```

---

## 19. Genesis Block and Initial State (NORMATIVE)

### 19.1 Genesis Block Format
```rust
pub struct GenesisBlock {
    pub chain_id: u32,
    pub timestamp: u64,  // Unix seconds
    pub initial_utxos: Vec<UTXOEntry>,
    pub initial_avs: Vec<InitialValidatorEntry>,
}

pub struct UTXOEntry {
    pub txid: Hash256,
    pub output_index: u32,
    pub value: u64,
    pub script: bytes,  // P2PKH script locking to a TIME1... wallet address
}

pub struct InitialValidatorEntry {
    pub mn_id: Hash256,  // derived from pubkey hash
    pub pubkey: [u8; 32],
    pub vrf_pubkey: [u8; 32],
    pub tier_weight: u16,
}
```

**Genesis UTXO addressing:** The `script` field of each `UTXOEntry` MUST encode a standard P2PKH script locking the output to a TIME wallet address (bech32m `TIME1…` format — see §23 for address encoding). IP addresses MUST NOT be used as UTXO recipients. Genesis-block UTXOs are real, spendable on-chain outputs from block 0 and are indistinguishable from UTXOs created by normal transactions.

### 19.2 Bootstrap Procedure (Chicken-Egg Problem)
**Challenge:** AVS is required to validate, but AVS membership is on-chain.

**Solution:**
1. Genesis block specifies `initial_avs` set (pre-agreed by operators).
2. Each initial validator MUST stake on-chain in the first few blocks.
3. Once staking transaction is archived, stake becomes eligible.
4. AVS membership is then enforced by heartbeat + witness attestation (§5.4).

**Testnet Genesis (example):**
```json
{
  "chain_id": 1,
  "timestamp": 1703376000,
  "initial_avs": [
    {
      "mn_id": "mn_1...",
      "pubkey": "...",
      "tier_weight": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

### 19.3 Chain ID Assignment
- **Mainnet:** `chain_id = 1`
- **Testnet:** `chain_id = 2`
- **Devnet:** `chain_id = 3`

All signed objects (§8.1, §5.4) MUST include the correct `chain_id` to prevent replay attacks.

---

## 20. Clock Synchronization Requirements (NORMATIVE)

### 20.1 Wall-Clock Dependency
TimeLock (§9) relies on wall-clock time for slot alignment. Clocks MUST be synchronized to within a tight tolerance.

```
CLOCK_SYNC_REQUIREMENT = NTP v4 (RFC 5905) or GPS/PTP
MAX_CLOCK_DRIFT = ±10 seconds (acceptable per node)
```

### 20.2 Slot Boundary Grace Period
```
SLOT_GRACE_PERIOD = 30 seconds
- Blocks with slot_time in [current_slot - 30s, current_slot + 30s] are accepted
- Prevents legitimate blocks from being rejected due to minor clock skew
```

### 20.3 Future Block Rejection
```
FUTURE_BLOCK_TOLERANCE = 5 seconds
- Reject blocks with slot_time > now() + 5s
- Defends against attacks by nodes with skewed clocks
```

### 20.4 NTP Configuration (Recommended)
```
# /etc/ntp.conf (Linux) or equivalent
server 0.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 1.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 2.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 3.pool.ntp.org iburst

# Ensure systemd-timesyncd or ntpd is running
# Check: ntpq -p (or timedatectl status)
```

---

## 21. Light Client and SPV Support (OPTIONAL)

### 21.1 Light Client Model
Clients that cannot run full validation (e.g., mobile wallets) MAY:
- Verify transactions against **TimeProof** (§8) rather than replaying TimeVote consensus
- Query trusted peers for AVS snapshots (§8.4)
- Verify TimeProof signatures against AVS snapshot at transaction's `slot_index`

### 21.2 Block Header Format for Light Clients
```rust
pub struct BlockHeader {
    pub height: u64,
    pub slot_index: u64,
    pub slot_time: u64,
    pub prev_block_hash: Hash256,
    pub producer_id: Hash256,
    pub vrf_output: [u8; 32],
    pub vrf_proof: bytes,
    pub finalized_root: Hash256,  // Merkle root of entries
    pub timestamp_ms: u64,
    /// Ed25519 signature of the block hash by the block producer.
    /// Prevents a valid VRF proof from being reused with tampered block
    /// contents (transactions, rewards, merkle root).
    /// Empty for pre-v1.3.0 blocks (backward-compatible via serde default).
    pub producer_signature: Vec<u8>,
}
```

### 21.3 Merkle Proof for Entry Verification
Light clients can verify that a specific `(txid, timeproof_hash)` is included in a block:

```rust
pub struct EntryProof {
    pub txid: Hash256,
    pub timeproof_hash: Hash256,
    pub inclusion_path: Vec<Hash256>,  // Merkle path to finalized_root
    pub leaf_index: u32,
}

// Verify: compute_merkle_root(txid || timeproof_hash, inclusion_path, leaf_index) == block.finalized_root
```

### 21.4 Trust Model
Light clients MUST:
1. Trust the canonical **header chain** (validated via VRF sortition).
2. Trust AVS snapshots returned by queried peers (or require multiple confirmations).
3. Assume TimeProof signature verification is correct (standard Ed25519).

---

## 22. Error Recovery and Edge Cases (NORMATIVE)

### 22.1 Conflicting TimeProofs
**Issue (§8.7):** Two conflicting transactions both obtain valid TimeProofs.

**Safety violation:** One or more AVS members produced signatures for conflicting transactions, or signatures were forged.

**Recovery:**
```
ON_CONFLICTING_TIMEPROOF:
  1. Detect: compare (txid_A, timeproof_A) vs (txid_B, timeproof_B) for same input outpoint
  2. Log: record both TimeProofs and all signatories as emergency event
  3. Halt: stop automatic finalization for that outpoint
  4. Surface: alert operators and light clients
  5. (Future) Governance: require manual intervention or protocol upgrade
     to slash dishonest validators if cryptographic proof of fraud exists
```

### 22.2 Network Partition Recovery
**Scenario:** Network splits; subsets temporarily cannot reach each other.

**Local behavior:**
- Each partition continues local consensus and block production
- Transactions finalize independently in each partition

**Reconnection:**
```
ON_RECONNECTION:
  1. Exchange block headers across partitions
  2. Canonical chain = partition with highest cumulative AVS weight (sum of all blocks' producers' weight)
  3. Minority partition rolls back uncommitted TimeProofs (§8.6)
  4. Replay finalized transactions from majority onto minority's UTXO set
```

**Implementation note:** Requires persistent block storage and reorg logic.

### 22.3 Orphan Transaction Handling
**Scenario:** A transaction references an input UTXO that has not yet been checkpointed.

**Behavior:**
```
ORPHAN_TXS:
  1. Keep in separate orphan pool (max 1000 entries, by LRU)
  2. When referenced UTXO is archived, retry orphan pool
  3. If orphan not resolved after 72 hours, evict
```

### 22.4 AVS Membership Disputes
**Scenario:** Node claims a masternode is AVS-active, but heartbeat attestations disagree.

**Resolution:**
```
MEMBERSHIP_VERIFICATION:
  - Require ≥ WITNESS_MIN (default 3) valid witness attestations
  - If dispute, request attestations from multiple peers
  - Canonical membership = result from peers with highest total weight
  - Cache locally for 1 heartbeat period (60s)
```

### 22.5 Post-Initial-Sync Chain Stall Recovery
**Scenario:** A node completes initial sync but then cannot acquire any new blocks (peers time out, all sync attempts fail). The node is live but stuck.

**Behavior:**
```
SYNC_WATCHDOG (runs every 300 s after initial sync):
  1. Read local height H
  2. Query all connected peers for their chain tips
  3. If max_peer_height > H + 1:
       a. Log warning with heights
       b. Call sync_from_peers(max_peer_height)
  4. sync_from_peers() is idempotent — concurrent calls are ignored via is_syncing flag
```

**Design rationale:** The initial sync loop exits after two rounds of peer timeouts and declares "sync complete" to unblock block production. Without the watchdog, a node that got stuck due to registry divergence or peer unavailability would remain at the stale height indefinitely.

### 22.6 Collateral Deregistration Grace Period
**Scenario:** A masternode's collateral UTXO appears missing in a node's UTXO set immediately after a block is applied, but the UTXO is present on other nodes (transient divergence at block boundaries).

**Behavior:**
```
COLLATERAL_CLEANUP (called after each block):
  FOR each masternode M with a collateral_outpoint:
    IF collateral UTXO exists in UTXO set:
      reset miss_count[M] = 0
    ELSE:
      miss_count[M] += 1
      IF miss_count[M] >= 3:
        deregister M, unlock collateral
      ELSE:
        log warning, defer deregistration
```

**Threshold:** 3 consecutive misses (≈ 30 minutes at 10-minute block time). This provides ample time for UTXO-set convergence while still deregistering genuinely spent collateral within 3 blocks.

---

### 22.7 Masternode Deregistration via Signed MasternodeUnlock (NORMATIVE)

Operators MAY deregister a masternode without spending the collateral UTXO by
broadcasting a signed `MasternodeUnlock` gossip message. This is the preferred
deregistration mechanism.

#### 22.7.1 Message Format

```
MasternodeUnlock {
    address:             String,   // bech32m masternode wallet address
    collateral_outpoint: OutPoint, // { txid: Hash256, vout: u32 }
    timestamp:           u64,      // Unix time of signing
    signature:           Vec<u8>,  // Ed25519; #[serde(default)] for backward compat
}
```

#### 22.7.2 Signature Scheme

The `signature` MUST be an Ed25519 signature (using `masternodeprivkey`) over the
UTF-8 encoding of the following canonical proof string:

```
TIME_COLLATERAL_REVOKE:<address>:<txid_hex>:<vout>:<timestamp>
```

where `<txid_hex>` is the lowercase hex-encoded 32-byte txid, `<vout>` is the
decimal string of the output index, and `<timestamp>` is the decimal Unix
timestamp.

#### 22.7.3 Verification Rules

A receiving node MUST process a `MasternodeUnlock` as follows:

1. Look up the registered masternode by `address`. If not found, silently discard.
2. Check `timestamp` is within ±300 seconds of the node's current time (replay
   protection). If out of range, discard.
3. **Signed revoke:** If `signature` is non-empty, verify the Ed25519 signature
   against the stored `public_key` for `address` using the proof string from
   §22.7.2. If verification fails, record a violation against the relaying peer
   and discard.
4. **Unsigned revoke:** If `signature` is empty, accept only if the message
   arrives on a direct (non-relayed) TCP connection whose source IP matches the
   masternode's registered IP address. Unsigned revokes MUST NOT be relayed.
5. On successful verification: unregister the masternode, queue the collateral
   UTXO for unlock (transition from `Locked` to `Unspent`), and relay the signed
   message to all connected peers.

#### 22.7.4 Operator Workflow

```
Operator action:
  1. Comment out (or remove) collateral line in masternode.conf
  2. Restart timed

Daemon behaviour on startup:
  a. Detect stale outpoint (present in sled, absent from masternode.conf)
  b. Record OutPoint → masternode_address mapping
  c. Release local collateral lock
  d. After 15 s (once peers connect): sign and broadcast MasternodeUnlock
  e. Receiving peers verify and release their collateral locks

Result:
  - All nodes release the lock within ~15 s of restart
  - Collateral UTXO is freely spendable from the originating wallet
  - No on-chain transaction required
```

#### 22.7.5 Fallback: Automatic Deregistration via UTXO Spending

If the operator spends the collateral UTXO without broadcasting a
`MasternodeUnlock`, the grace-period mechanism (§22.6) will deregister the
masternode after 3 consecutive collateral-miss checks (≈ 30 minutes).

### 23.1 Address Encoding
```
ADDRESS_FORMAT = bech32m (BIP 350)
ADDRESS_PREFIX = "time1" (mainnet)
ADDRESS_PREFIX = "timet" (testnet)
```

**Example address:** `time1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx`

### 23.2 Address Generation
```
address = bech32m_encode("time1", RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)))
```

### 23.3 Wallet RPC API (Recommended)
Implementations SHOULD expose a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "sendtransaction",
  "params": { "tx": "<hex>" },
  "id": 1
}

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "gettransaction",
  "params": { "txid": "<hash>" },
  "id": 2
}

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "getbalance",
  "params": { "address": "<bech32>" },
  "id": 3
}
```

---

## 24. Mempool Management and Fee Estimation (NORMATIVE)

### 24.1 Mempool Size and Limits
```
MAX_MEMPOOL_SIZE = 100 MB
MAX_ENTRIES_PER_BLOCK = 10,000
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 2 MB
EVICTION_POLICY = lowest_fee_rate_first
```

### 24.2 Transaction Expiry
```
TX_EXPIRY_PERIOD = 72 hours
- Transactions not finalized within 72 hours are evicted from mempool
- Prevents mempool bloat from stuck transactions
```

### 24.3 Fee Estimation
Wallets should estimate fees based on:
```
fee_per_byte = median(fees_in_recent_finalized_txs / tx_size)
// or dynamic algorithm observing mempool congestion
```

**Minimum fee:** `MIN_FEE = 0.001 TIME per transaction`

---

## 25. Economic Model (NORMATIVE)

### 25.1 Initial Supply
```
INITIAL_SUPPLY = 0 (fair launch with no pre-mine)
```

### 25.2 Reward Schedule

**Implementation:**
```
Per checkpoint block (§10):
BLOCK_REWARD = 100 TIME (fixed)
Total reward = BLOCK_REWARD + transaction_fees

Blocks per year: 52,596 (600-second intervals)
Annual issuance: 5,259,600 TIME/year (constant)
```

**Inflation Rate Projection:**

| Year | Total Supply | Annual Inflation | Notes |
|------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | 5.26M TIME | ∞% → 0% | Bootstrap year |
| 5 | 26.3M TIME | 20% | Early growth |
| 10 | 52.6M TIME | 10% | Maturing network |
| 20 | 105M TIME | 5% | Stable operation |
| 50 | 263M TIME | 2% | Long-term equilibrium |

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Fixed issuance** (not supply-capped like Bitcoin)
- **Decreasing inflation rate** (percentage declines as supply grows)
- **Perpetual security budget** (always incentivizes validators)
- **No halving events** (predictable for economic planning)

### 25.3 Economic Philosophy: Transactional Utility Over Scarcity

**Design Goal:** TIME Coin is optimized as a **medium of exchange**, not a store of value.

**Rationale:**

Bitcoin's scarcity-driven model (21M cap) created a fundamental tension:
- **Success → High value → Poor for everyday transactions**
- Small purchases become impractical (e.g., $0.50 coffee requires 0.000001 BTC)
- Users hoard rather than spend (Gresham's law: "good money drives out bad")
- Psychological barrier: "I paid 10,000 BTC for pizza" regret

**TIME Coin's Alternative Approach:**

1. **Stable Value Target**
   - Predictable, modest inflation creates stable purchasing power
   - Similar philosophy to fiat currencies or algorithmic stablecoins
   - Goal: 1 TIME ≈ consistent real-world value over years
   - Encourages spending and circulation (velocity of money)

2. **Transaction-First Economics**
   - Low, predictable fees (§24: 0.001 TIME minimum)
   - Fast finality (<1s) removes friction from daily use
   - Economic incentives favor network usage over hoarding

3. **Security Through Utility**
   - Bitcoin's long-term security depends on fees (after 2140)
   - TIME Coin maintains security through perpetual issuance
   - No "fee pressure crisis" when block rewards end
   - Validator incentives remain strong regardless of transaction volume

4. **Controlled Inflation vs. Hyperinflation**
   - Fixed 100 TIME/block ≠ unlimited money printing
   - Inflation rate naturally decreases: 20% (year 5) → 2% (year 50)
   - Similar to Ethereum post-merge (~1-2% annual issuance)
   - Predictable, algorithmic issuance (not central bank discretion)

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Bitcoin | TIME Coin |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Supply Cap** | 21M BTC (hard cap) | No cap (decreasing % inflation) |
| **Issuance** | Halving every 4 years | Fixed 100/block forever |
| **Philosophy** | Digital gold / Store of value | Digital cash / Medium of exchange |
| **User Behavior** | Encouraged to hold | Encouraged to transact |
| **Long-term Security** | Dependent on fees alone | Perpetual block rewards |
| **Price Stability** | High volatility expected | Stable value preferred |
| **Use Case** | Savings / Investment | Daily transactions / Payments |

**Trade-offs Acknowledged:**

❌ **Not optimized for:**
- "Number go up" investment thesis
- Scarcity-driven value appreciation
- Deflationary store-of-value narrative

✅ **Optimized for:**
- Everyday payments and transactions
- Predictable purchasing power
- Network utility and adoption
- Long-term validator economics
- Real-world usability

**Governance Note:**

This economic model is subject to community consensus. Future governance proposals may:
- Implement fee burning (reduce net inflation during high usage)
- Adjust reward schedule based on network maturity
- Introduce supply cap if community decides scarcity is preferred
- Modify parameters through on-chain voting (requires protocol upgrade)

**Reference:** This design philosophy aligns with Satoshi Nakamoto's original Bitcoin whitepaper subtitle: "A Peer-to-Peer **Electronic Cash System**" — emphasizing the transactional use case that Bitcoin's scarcity model ultimately moved away from.

### 25.4 Reward Distribution

Two distribution modes apply depending on whether paid-tier nodes are present (see §10.4 for the normative specification).

**Tier-Based Distribution (at least one paid-tier node — see §10.4 for normative spec):**
```
Total Reward = 100 TIME + transaction_fees

Distribution:
   5 TIME → Treasury
  30 TIME + transaction_fees → Block Producer (VRF-selected proposer)
  65 TIME → Four independent tier pools:
    Gold:   25 TIME    Silver: 18 TIME
    Bronze: 14 TIME    Free:    8 TIME

Within each tier:
- Equal share per selected recipient
- Max 25 recipients per tier per block
- Fairness rotation: longest-waiting nodes selected first
- If tier is empty, its pool goes to the block producer
- No minimum per-node threshold — any share amount is valid
```

**All-Free Distribution (no paid-tier nodes present):**
```
Total Reward = 100 TIME + transaction_fees

Distribution:
   5 TIME → Treasury
  95 TIME + transaction_fees → Free pool, split equally among up to 25
             eligible Free nodes (sorted by fairness bonus)

No separate producer/leader bonus. The block producer is one of the Free
nodes sharing the pool.
```

**Anti-Sybil Maturity Gate:**
```
Free-tier masternodes must be continuously registered for a minimum number of
blocks before becoming eligible for VRF sortition or the tier pool:

- Mainnet: 72 blocks (~12 hours at 10 min/block)
- Testnet: 0 blocks (no gate, for rapid development iteration)

Paid tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold) have no maturity requirement — their collateral
provides sufficient sybil resistance.
```

**Example: Large Network — Tier-Based (500 nodes: 5 Gold, 20 Silver, 75 Bronze, 400 Free):**
```
Block producer: Silver node (won VRF sortition)
- Treasury: 5 TIME
- Leader bonus: 30 TIME + fees
- Silver pool share: 18 / 20 = 0.9 TIME
- Total: 30.9 TIME + fees

Gold pool: 25 TIME ÷ 5 = 5 TIME each
Silver pool: 18 TIME ÷ 20 = 0.9 TIME each (19 non-producers)
Bronze pool: 14 TIME ÷ 25 = 0.56 TIME each (top 25 of 75, rotated by fairness)
Free pool: 8 TIME ÷ 25 = 0.32 TIME each (top 25 of 400, rotated by fairness)

Next block: different 25 Bronze and 25 Free nodes selected via fairness rotation.
All Bronze nodes paid within ~3 blocks. All Free nodes paid within ~16 blocks.
```

**Example: All-Free Network (10 Free nodes, no paid tier):**
```
Block producer: Free node A (won VRF sortition)
- Treasury: 5 TIME
- Free pool: 95 TIME ÷ 10 = 9.5 TIME each (all 10 nodes paid, no leader bonus)
```

**Fair APY Design:**
- Treasury receives 5 TIME every block regardless of network composition
- Leader bonus (tier-based mode) incentivizes block production via VRF competition
- Per-tier pools guarantee each tier has a dedicated reward allocation
- All-Free mode maximizes earnings for Free nodes when no paid tier is present
- Fairness rotation ensures every node gets paid in turn (no starvation)
- Anti-sybil maturity gate prevents rapid Free-tier node spinning

See §10.4 for the normative reward calculation specification.

## Appendix A: Fee Collection Mechanism

Transaction fees ARE being collected and added to block rewards. This appendix explains how the fee collection system works end-to-end.

### Fee Flow: Step-by-Step

#### 1. Transaction Submission

**Location:** `src/consensus.rs:1343-1437` (validate_transaction)

When a user submits a transaction:
```rust
// Fee calculation
let input_sum: u64 = sum of all input UTXOs
let output_sum: u64 = sum of all outputs
let fee = input_sum - output_sum

// Fee validation
if fee < MIN_TX_FEE (1,000 satoshis) {
    reject
}
if fee < output_sum / 1000 (0.1% proportional) {
    reject
}
```

**Example Transaction:**
- Input: 1,000,000 satoshis (0.01 TIME)
- Output: 998,000 satoshis
- **Fee: 2,000 satoshis** (0.2% - meets both minimums)

---

#### 2. Transaction Pool Storage

**Location:** `src/transaction_pool.rs:100-136` (add_transaction)

Transaction entry includes fee:
```rust
pub struct TransactionEntry {
    pub tx: Transaction,
    pub fee: u64,              // ← Fee stored here
    pub size: usize,
    pub added_at: Instant,
    pub submitter: Option<String>,
}
```

Stored in mempool:
- **Pending pool**: Transactions awaiting finalization
- **Finalized pool**: Transactions ready for block inclusion

---

#### 3. Fee Accumulation

**Location:** `src/transaction_pool.rs:236-238` (get_total_fees)

When block is produced, total fees calculated:
```rust
pub fn get_total_fees(&self) -> u64 {
    self.finalized
        .iter()
        .map(|e| e.value().fee)
        .sum()
}
```

This sums ALL fees from finalized transactions ready for the block.

---

#### 4. Block Reward Calculation

**Location:** `src/blockchain.rs:1526-1532` (produce_block)

```rust
// Get finalized transactions
let finalized_txs = self.consensus.get_finalized_transactions_for_block();

// Calculate total fees from all finalized transactions
let total_fees = self.consensus.tx_pool.get_total_fees();

// Add fees to base block reward
let base_reward = BLOCK_REWARD_SATOSHIS; // 100 TIME = 10,000,000,000 satoshis
let total_reward = base_reward + total_fees;

// Distribute to masternodes
let rewards = self.calculate_rewards_with_amount(&masternodes, total_reward);
```

**Example Block Reward:**
- Base reward: 10,000,000,000 satoshis (100 TIME)
- Collected fees: 50,000 satoshis (0.0005 TIME from user transactions)
- **Total reward: 10,000,050,000 satoshis (100.0005 TIME)**

#### 5. Coinbase Transaction Creation

**Location:** `src/blockchain.rs:1555-1565`

```rust
let coinbase = Transaction {
    version: 1,
    inputs: vec![],  // No inputs - creates new coins
    outputs: vec![TxOutput {
        value: total_reward,  // ← Base reward + ALL fees
        script_pubkey: script,
    }],
};
```

The coinbase creates **base_reward + total_fees** worth of new TIME.

---

#### 6. Reward Distribution

**Location:** `src/blockchain.rs:1297-1342` (calculate_rewards_with_amount)

```rust
// For each masternode, calculate proportional share
for (i, mn) in masternodes.iter().enumerate() {
    let gross_share = if i == masternodes.len() - 1 {
        // Last masternode gets remainder (prevents rounding errors)
        total_reward - distributed
    } else {
        (total_reward * mn.masternode.tier.reward_weight()) / total_weight
    };

    // Deduct 0.1% fee from masternode reward
    let fee = gross_share / 1000; // 0.1% = 1/1000
    let net_share = gross_share.saturating_sub(fee);

    rewards.push((mn.masternode.address.clone(), net_share));
}
```

**Example with 6 masternodes (all Bronze tier):**
- Total reward: 10,000,050,000 satoshis (100.0005 TIME)
- Per masternode (gross): 1,666,675,000 satoshis (16.666675 TIME)
- 0.1% fee deducted: 1,666,675 satoshis (0.0166667 TIME)
- Per masternode (net): 1,665,008,325 satoshis (16.650083 TIME)

**Fee destination:** The 0.1% fee from each masternode reward is NOT distributed — it is effectively burned, creating slight deflation.

---

#### 7. Reward Distribution Transaction

**Location:** `src/blockchain.rs:1567-1600`

```rust
let reward_distribution = Transaction {
    version: 1,
    inputs: vec![TransactionInput {
        previous_output: OutPoint {
            txid: coinbase.txid(),  // Spends coinbase
            vout: 0,
        },
        script_sig: vec![],
        sequence: 0xFFFFFFFF,
    }],
    outputs: rewards  // One output per masternode
        .iter()
        .map(|(address, amount)| TxOutput {
            value: *amount,
            script_pubkey: address.as_bytes().to_vec(),
        })
        .collect(),
};
```

This transaction:
- **Spends** the coinbase output (total_reward)
- **Distributes** to masternodes after 0.1% fee deduction
- **Difference** between input and outputs = burned fee

---

#### 8. Block Structure

**Location:** `src/blockchain.rs:1645-1650`

```rust
Block {
    header: BlockHeader {
        height: next_height,
        block_reward: total_reward,  // ← Includes fees
        // ...
    },
    transactions: vec![
        coinbase,              // Creates total_reward (base + fees)
        reward_distribution,   // Distributes ~99.9% to masternodes
        ...finalized_txs       // User transactions (already paid fees)
    ],
    masternode_rewards: rewards,  // Metadata for validation
}
```

---

#### 9. Fee Cleanup After Block

**Location:** `src/blockchain.rs:1791-1792`

```rust
// After block is added to chain
self.consensus.clear_finalized_transactions();
```

This clears the finalized pool, removing transactions that were included in the block. Their fees have been collected and distributed.

---

### Fee Validation

**Location:** `src/blockchain.rs:2400-2425`

```rust
// Verify distributed amount is ~99.9% of block_reward
let total_distributed: u64 = reward_dist.outputs.iter().map(|o| o.value).sum();
let expected_total = block.header.block_reward;

// Calculate expected fee (0.1% of block reward)
let expected_fee = expected_total / 1000;
let expected_distributed = expected_total.saturating_sub(expected_fee);

// Allow tolerance for rounding
let tolerance = expected_fee / 100;
let lower_bound = expected_distributed.saturating_sub(tolerance);
let upper_bound = expected_total;

if total_distributed < lower_bound || total_distributed > upper_bound {
    return Err("Invalid reward distribution");
}
```

This ensures:
- Fees are being collected (total > base_reward if there are transactions)
- Distribution matches expected ~99.9% after masternode fee deduction
- No inflation attacks (can't claim more than block_reward)

---

### Fee Economics

#### Per Transaction
- **Minimum absolute:** 1,000 satoshis (0.00001 TIME)
- **Minimum proportional:** 0.1% of transaction amount
- **Actual fee:** Higher of the two minimums

#### Per Block
- **Base reward:** 100 TIME (10,000,000,000 satoshis)
- **Transaction fees:** Sum of all finalized transaction fees
- **Total reward:** Base + fees
- **Masternode fee:** 0.1% of gross share per masternode
- **Net distribution:** ~99.9% of total reward
- **Burned:** ~0.1% of total reward (masternode fees)

#### Example Block with 100 Transactions

**Assumptions:**
- 100 user transactions included
- Average transaction: 0.01 TIME with 0.1% fee = 1,000 satoshis fee
- Total transaction fees: 100,000 satoshis (0.001 TIME)
- 6 masternodes (all Bronze tier)

**Calculations:**
1. **Base reward:** 10,000,000,000 satoshis (100 TIME)
2. **Collected fees:** 100,000 satoshis (0.001 TIME)
3. **Total reward:** 10,000,100,000 satoshis (100.001 TIME)
4. **Per masternode (gross):** 1,666,683,333 satoshis (16.6668333 TIME)
5. **Masternode fee (0.1%):** 1,666,683 satoshis (0.0166668 TIME)
6. **Per masternode (net):** 1,665,016,650 satoshis (16.6501665 TIME)
7. **Total distributed:** 9,990,099,900 satoshis (99.900999 TIME)
8. **Burned in masternode fees:** 10,000,100 satoshis (0.100001 TIME)

**Result:**
- Users paid 0.001 TIME in transaction fees
- Masternodes received 100.001 TIME gross, 99.9 TIME net
- 0.1% of block reward burned (0.100001 TIME)

---

### Fee Collection Summary

✅ **Transaction fees ARE collected and added to block rewards**

**Flow:**
1. Users pay fees (input_sum - output_sum)
2. Fees tracked in transaction pool entries
3. When block produced, all finalized transaction fees summed
4. Total reward = base_reward + collected_fees
5. Coinbase creates total_reward
6. Reward distribution transaction distributes ~99.9% to masternodes
7. 0.1% burned as masternode fee (slight deflation)
8. Finalized pool cleared after block inclusion

**Security:**
- Validation ensures distributed amount matches block_reward ±tolerance
- Cannot inflate supply beyond base_reward + actual_fees
- Double-counting prevented by validation

## Appendix B: Cryptography Rationale

TIME Coin uses three cryptographic algorithms (BLAKE3, Ed25519, ECVRF) because each solves a fundamentally different problem. Ed25519 alone is insufficient.

---

### The Three Algorithms and Their Roles

#### 1. Ed25519 (Signature Scheme)

```
Use case: Sign and verify messages
Problem solved: Authentication & non-repudiation
```

**What it does:**
- Signs transactions, heartbeats, and finality votes
- Proves a message came from a specific private key
- Example: `FinalityVote.signature = Ed25519_Sign(voter_privkey, vote_data)`

**Why it alone is not enough:**
- Ed25519 does not produce a **unique, deterministic hash** of data
- You need a hash to create transaction IDs, block hashes, etc.
- Signatures are not content-addressable identifiers

**Example of why this matters:**
```
Two ways to represent the same transaction:
  TX(format_A) → different bytes → Ed25519 signs different messages → different sigs
  TX(format_B) → different bytes → but it's the same transaction!

Without a canonical hash:
  - Users can't agree on a transaction ID
  - Network gets confused about what was finalized
```

---

#### 2. BLAKE3 (Hash Function)

```
Use case: Compute deterministic, content-addressable hashes
Problem solved: Transaction IDs, block hashes, merkle roots
```

**What it does:**
- Computes `txid = BLAKE3(canonical_tx_bytes)`
- Creates immutable content addresses
- Fast, secure, modern alternative to SHA-256

**Why BLAKE3 over SHA-256d?**
- Faster (parallel hashing)
- Simpler (not double-hash)
- Same security level (256-bit output)
- Modern standard

---

#### 3. ECVRF (Verifiable Random Function)

```
Use case: Deterministic but unpredictable sortition for TimeLock block production
Problem solved: Fair, verifiable block leader selection
```

**What it does:**
- Each masternode computes: `score = VRF(privkey, prev_block_hash || slot_time || chain_id)`
- Score is deterministic (same input → same output)
- But unpredictable (only privkey holder can compute it first)
- Verifiable (anyone with pubkey can check the proof)

**Example:**
```
Masternode A with privkey_A:
  score_A = VRF(privkey_A, input) = 0x123abc...

Masternode B with privkey_B:
  score_B = VRF(privkey_B, input) = 0x456def...

Canonical leader = min(score_A, score_B) = Masternode B
(lowest score wins)
```

**Why you need VRF (not just Ed25519 or BLAKE3):**

| Requirement | Ed25519 | BLAKE3 | VRF |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deterministic? | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Unpredictable (before reveal)? | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Verifiable by anyone? | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Creates sortition ranking? | ✗ | Cannot | ✓ |

**Why BLAKE3 alone does not work for TimeLock:**
```
If block leader = lowest_hash(privkey || input):
  • Everyone can compute hash(input) → predictable!
  • Adversary can forge a privkey with low hash
  • No security

VRF fixes this:
  • Binds output to a private key
  • Unpredictable until the holder reveals it
  • Cryptographically proven (VRF proof)
```

**Why Ed25519 does not replace VRF:**
```
Ed25519 signatures are not sortition-ready:
  • Not designed for deterministic output comparison
  • Signatures don't create a numeric ordering
  • No proof of "lowest score"

VRF is purpose-built for:
  • Deterministic output
  • Numeric ordering
  • Verifiable randomness
```

---

### Real-World Example: What Breaks If You Use Only Ed25519?

#### TimeLock Block Production with Only Ed25519

```rust
// WRONG: Using Ed25519 to elect block producers
fn elect_leader(nodes: &[Masternode], slot: u64) {
    let input = format!("{}", slot);
    for node in nodes {
        let signature = node.ed25519_sign(&input);
        println!("Node {} signature: {:?}", node.id, signature);
    }
    // Problem: How do you compare signatures to pick the leader?
    // Signatures are bytes, but they're not deterministic numbers for sorting!
}
```

**Issues:**
1. **Signature size varies:** Ed25519 signatures are 64 bytes — hard to compare numerically
2. **Not designed for ranking:** Ed25519 assumes binary (valid/invalid), not "lower is better"
3. **Every signer produces different data:** Can't create a fair ordering
4. **Adversarial manipulation:** A node might create many privkeys until one produces a favorable signature

#### Correct Approach with VRF

```rust
// CORRECT: Using VRF to elect block producers
fn elect_leader(nodes: &[Masternode], slot: u64) {
    let input = format!("{}", slot);
    let mut scores = vec![];

    for node in nodes {
        let (vrf_output, vrf_proof) = node.vrf_prove(&input);
        assert!(node.pubkey.vrf_verify(&input, &vrf_output, &vrf_proof));
        scores.push((node.id, vrf_output));
    }

    scores.sort_by_key(|(_id, output)| output);
    let leader = scores[0].0;
    println!("Block leader: {} (score: {})", leader, scores[0].1);
}
```

**Advantages:**
1. **Deterministic:** Same node, same slot → same score
2. **Unpredictable:** Cannot compute score before privkey holder reveals it
3. **Verifiable:** Anyone can check the proof
4. **Rankable:** Numeric output allows sorting (lowest wins)
5. **Sybil-resistant:** Cannot game the system by creating many identities

---

### Why Not Use One Algorithm for All Three Roles?

| Use Case | Why Not… | Why Needed |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Sign votes** | Can't use BLAKE3 (not a sig scheme) or VRF (not designed for sigs) | **Ed25519** |
| **Hash transactions** | Can't use Ed25519 (not a hash func) or VRF (outputs are large, meant for ranking) | **BLAKE3** |
| **Elect block leaders** | Can't use Ed25519 (not sortition-ready) or BLAKE3 (predictable/anyone can compute) | **ECVRF** |

---

### Comparison with Bitcoin / Ethereum

#### Bitcoin Stack
```
Hash:      SHA-256d (SHA-256 twice)
Signature: ECDSA (secp256k1)
Random:    Proof-of-Work (compute-hard hashing)
```

TIME Coin uses **stake-weighted consensus** (not PoW), requires **VRF for fair leader sortition**, and adopts **modern BLAKE3** instead of SHA-256d.

#### Ethereum Stack
```
Hash:      Keccak-256 (not standard SHA-3)
Signature: ECDSA (secp256k1)
Random:    Beacon chain VRF (RANDAO + BLS)
```

Ethereum also recognizes that signatures, hashing, and randomness are three separate concerns. TIME Coin's stack is simpler and more standard (RFC 9381 ECVRF).

---

### Implementation Structure

#### Cryptography Dependency Chart

```
Transaction Flow:
  1. Create TX → BLAKE3_hash(tx_bytes) → txid
  2. Sign TX → Ed25519_sign(tx, privkey) → signature
  3. Include in TimeProof → Ed25519_verify(voter_pubkey, signature)

Block Production Flow:
  1. Compute slot → VRF(privkey, input) → (score, proof)
  2. Verify score → VRF_verify(pubkey, input, score, proof)
  3. Compare scores → min(all_scores) → select leader
```

#### Code Organization

```rust
mod hash {
    use blake3;
    pub fn tx_hash(tx: &Transaction) -> Hash256 { ... }
}

mod sign {
    use ed25519_dalek;
    pub fn sign_vote(vote: &FinalityVote, sk: &SecretKey) -> Signature { ... }
}

mod vrf {
    use ecvrf;  // RFC 9381
    pub fn prove_vrf(sk: &VrfSecretKey, input: &[u8]) -> (Output, Proof) { ... }
}
```

---

### Could We Simplify to Two Algorithms?

**Remove BLAKE3, use Ed25519 for hashing?** No — Ed25519 is a signature scheme, not a hash function. It produces 64-byte signatures, not content addresses.

**Remove VRF, use BLAKE3 for leader election?** No — BLAKE3 is deterministic but not private. Anyone can compute `BLAKE3(pubkey || slot)` before the slot, so there is no security advantage to having a private key.

**Remove Ed25519, use BLAKE3 + HMAC for signatures?** No — BLAKE3+HMAC has no asymmetric cryptography, cannot prove the sender publicly, and requires shared secrets that are hard to manage at scale.

---

### Summary Table

| Algorithm | Role | Why Needed | Alternative |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **BLAKE3** | Hash (txid, blocks, commitments) | Content-addressable identifiers | SHA-256d (slower, less modern) |
| **Ed25519** | Sign messages (votes, txs, heartbeats) | Asymmetric authentication | ECDSA secp256k1 (larger keys) |
| **ECVRF** | Deterministic randomness for block election | Stake-weighted fair leader sortition | None (VRF is purpose-built) |

Each algorithm is irreplaceable. Combining them would either weaken security, increase complexity, or degrade performance.
