# 🔧 time-cli - Bitcoin-like RPC Client

## ✨ Overview

`time-cli` is a command-line tool for interacting with the TIME Coin daemon (`timed`) using Bitcoin-compatible RPC commands.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Basic usage (pretty JSON output by default)
./target/release/time-cli getblockchaininfo

# Compact JSON output (single line)
./target/release/time-cli --compact getblockchaininfo

# Human-readable output
./target/release/time-cli --human getblockchaininfo

# With custom RPC URL
./target/release/time-cli --rpc-url http://192.168.1.100:24101 getnetworkinfo
```

---

## 📊 Output Formats

TIME CLI supports three output formats:

### 1. Pretty JSON (Default)
```bash
time-cli getblockchaininfo
```
Returns formatted JSON (like Bitcoin Core):
```json
{
  "chain": "main",
  "blocks": 1,
  "consensus": "TimeVote",
  "instant_finality": true
}
```

### 2. Compact JSON
```bash
time-cli --compact getblockchaininfo
```
Returns single-line JSON for scripting:
```json
{"chain":"main","blocks":1,"consensus":"TimeVote","instant_finality":true}
```

### 3. Human-Readable
```bash
time-cli --human getblockchaininfo
```
Returns formatted text output:
```
Blockchain Information:
  Chain:            main
  Blocks:           1
  Consensus:        TimeVote
  Instant Finality: true
```

**Supported for --human flag:**
- `getblockchaininfo` - Formatted info
- `getblockcount` - Simple height display
- `getbalance` - Balance with TIME label
- `listunspent` - Table format
- `masternodelist` / `masternode list` - Table format
- `masternodestatus` / `masternode status` - Formatted status
- `getpeerinfo` - Table format
- `uptime` - Days/hours for ≥1 hour; minutes for sub-hour nodes
- All other commands default to pretty JSON

---

## 📋 Available Commands

### Blockchain Information

#### Get Blockchain Info
```bash
time-cli getblockchaininfo
```
Returns general blockchain information including chain, blocks, consensus type, and finality.

#### Get Block Count
```bash
time-cli getblockcount
```
Returns the current block height.

#### Get Block
```bash
time-cli getblock 1
```
Returns information about a specific block by height.

---

### Network Information

#### Get Network Info
```bash
time-cli getnetworkinfo
```
Returns network information including version, protocol, and connections.

#### Get Peer Info
```bash
time-cli getpeerinfo
```
Returns information about connected peers.

#### Manage Ban Lists
```bash
time-cli getbanlist
time-cli unban 154.217.246.86
time-cli unbansubnet 154.217.246.0/24
time-cli clearbanlist
```
Use `unban` for a single IP, `unbansubnet` for one CIDR subnet, and `clearbanlist` to remove all IP bans, subnet bans, and violation counters.

---

### UTXO & Transactions

#### Get UTXO Set Info
```bash
time-cli gettxoutsetinfo
```
Returns statistics about the UTXO set.

#### Get Transaction
```bash
time-cli gettransaction <txid>
```
Returns information about a specific transaction.

#### Get Raw Transaction
```bash
time-cli getrawtransaction <txid>
time-cli getrawtransaction <txid> --verbose
```
Returns raw transaction data.

#### Send Raw Transaction
```bash
time-cli sendrawtransaction <hex>
```
Broadcasts a raw transaction to the network.

#### List Unspent
```bash
time-cli listunspent
time-cli listunspent 6 9999
```
Lists unspent transaction outputs.

#### List Transactions
```bash
time-cli listtransactions
time-cli listtransactions 20
```
Lists recent wallet transactions (default 10, max specified by count argument). Each entry includes `txid`, `category` (send/receive/consolidation), `amount`, `confirmations`, and `time`. If the transaction contains an encrypted memo that this wallet can decrypt, a `"memo"` field is included in the output.

Block reward distributions include an encrypted `"Block Reward"` memo (self-send encrypted, visible only to the block-producing node).

Example output entry with memo:
```json
{
  "txid": "7ce5821a2faf...",
  "category": "consolidation",
  "amount": -2.59,
  "confirmations": 5,
  "time": 1710441600,
  "memo": "UTXO Consolidation"
}
```

---

### Masternode Operations

#### Generate Masternode Key
```bash
time-cli masternode genkey
```
Generates a new masternode private key (base58check-encoded Ed25519). Add the output to `masternodeprivkey=` in `time.conf`.

#### List Masternodes
```bash
time-cli masternode list
```
Returns list of all masternodes with their status, tier, and collateral lock status.

**Output includes:**
- Address
- Tier (Free, Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- Active status
- Uptime
- Collateral status (🔒 Locked or Legacy)

#### Masternode Status
```bash
time-cli masternode status
```
Returns status of this node's masternode (if configured).

> **Note:** Masternode registration and deregistration are managed via `time.conf` and `masternode.conf`. See the [Masternode Guide](MASTERNODE_GUIDE.md) for details.

> **Backward compatibility:** `masternodelist` and `masternodestatus` are still accepted as aliases.

#### List Locked Collaterals
```bash
time-cli listlockedcollaterals
```
Lists all currently locked collaterals with masternode details.

#### Release a Single Collateral Lock
```bash
time-cli releasecollateral <txid> <vout>
```
Releases the collateral lock for a specific UTXO and clears its persistent sled
anchor in one step. Use this when an old collateral is stuck after a tier upgrade
(e.g. Silver → Gold) without disturbing other active collateral locks.

```bash
# Example: free stuck Silver after upgrading to Gold
time-cli releasecollateral 38a43f69bd3f38f9f74981a8ba5ba120fe5aa7e9919b2396b7d383557757ea97 0
```

Remote nodes self-correct within 30 seconds when they receive the next gossip
announcement from the upgraded node.

#### Clear a Stale Collateral Anchor
```bash
time-cli clearcollateralanchor <txid>:<vout>
```
Deletes the `collateral_anchor` sled entry for an outpoint and auto-unbans any
IP banned for a hijack attempt on that outpoint. Use when the persistent anchor
points to the wrong node (e.g. reversed by gossip delivery order) so the
legitimate owner's next announcement can re-anchor cleanly.

```bash
time-cli clearcollateralanchor ce8b5f168aca656f6e9cca2a475f2db4b6033742c6d437f22217bb6ddb557de0:0
```

Note: `releasecollateral` also clears the anchor. Use `clearcollateralanchor`
when you only need to fix the anchor without releasing the lock (e.g. correcting
reversed anchors between two legitimate nodes).

#### Release ALL Collateral Locks
```bash
time-cli releaseallcollaterals
```
Releases every collateral lock on this node without touching transaction UTXO
locks. Active masternodes re-lock their collateral within 30 seconds via their
next gossip announcement. Use as a last resort when multiple collaterals are
stuck or a squatter has locked UTXOs belonging to legitimate nodes.

---

### Consensus Information

#### Get Consensus Info
```bash
time-cli getconsensusinfo
```
Returns information about the TimeVote consensus:
- Type (TimeVote)
- Number of masternodes
- Quorum requirements
- Finality time

---

### Governance

On-chain governance allows Bronze/Silver/Gold masternodes to submit proposals and vote on protocol changes. See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for the full reference.

#### Submit a Proposal

```bash
# Treasury disbursement
time-cli submitproposal treasury <recipient_address> <amount_TIME> "<description>"

# Fee schedule change
time-cli submitproposal feeschedule <new_min_fee_TIME> '<[{"upper":100,"rate_bps":100},...]>'
```

Returns `{"proposal_id":"<64-hex>"}`. The proposal is broadcast to all peers immediately. Requires an unlocked wallet and an active Bronze/Silver/Gold masternode.

#### Vote on a Proposal

```bash
time-cli voteproposal <proposal_id> yes
time-cli voteproposal <proposal_id> no
```

Votes are stake-weighted (Bronze=1, Silver=10, Gold=100). A proposal passes when YES weight ≥ 67% of total active governance weight at the end of the 1,008-block voting window (~1 week).

#### List Proposals

```bash
# All proposals
time-cli listproposals

# Filter by status: active, passed, failed, executed
time-cli listproposals active
```

#### Get Proposal Detail

```bash
time-cli getproposal <proposal_id>
```

Returns full proposal detail including current vote tally, yes/total weight, and quorum percentage.

#### Get Fee Schedule

```bash
time-cli getfeeschedule
```

Returns the live fee schedule currently in effect on the network (minimum fee and tiered rate table). Use this to verify the current rates before sending or to inspect the result of a passed fee-schedule governance proposal.

---

### Wallet Operations

#### Get Balance
```bash
time-cli getbalance
```
Returns wallet balance.

#### Send to Address
```bash
time-cli sendtoaddress <address> <amount>
time-cli sendtoaddress <address> <amount> --subtract-fee
time-cli sendtoaddress <address> <amount> --memo "Payment for invoice #42"
```
Send TIME to an address. Fee is tiered (1% for amounts under 100 TIME, 0.5% under 1,000 TIME, 0.25% under 10,000 TIME, 0.1% above), with a flat minimum of 0.01 TIME. Added on top by default. Use `--subtract-fee` to deduct the fee from the send amount instead.

**Minimum send amount: 1 TIME.** Amounts below 1 TIME are rejected at the protocol level (the 0.01 TIME flat fee would represent ≥1% of the amount). Self-sends (UTXO consolidation) are exempt from this minimum.

**Options:**
- `--subtract-fee` — Deduct fee from the send amount (recipient gets amount minus fee)
- `--nowait` — Return TXID immediately without waiting for finality
- `--memo <text>` — Attach an encrypted memo (max 256 chars). The memo is encrypted using ECDH (X25519) + AES-256-GCM so that only the sender and recipient can read it. Other nodes see only ciphertext on-chain.

**Memo notes:** The recipient must have at least one prior on-chain transaction for their public key to be known. If the key is unavailable, the transaction sends without a memo. Memos appear in `listtransactions` output when decryptable.

#### Validate Address
```bash
time-cli validateaddress <address>
```
Validates a TIME Coin address.

#### Merge UTXOs
```bash
time-cli mergeutxos
time-cli mergeutxos --min-count 5 --max-count 50
```
Merge multiple UTXOs into one to reduce UTXO set size.

#### Request Payment
```bash
time-cli request-payment 50.0
time-cli request-payment 50.0 --memo "Invoice #42" --label "Alice's Shop"
```
Generate a payment request URI that you can share via email, text, or QR code. The URI includes your address, public key (for encrypted memos), requested amount, and an optional description.

Example output:
```
timecoin:TIME0AsqaMhk...?amount=50&pubkey=a1b2c3...&memo=Invoice%20%2342&label=Alice%27s%20Shop
```

The payer's wallet will automatically cache your public key, enabling encrypted memo support for this and future transactions.

#### Pay a Payment Request
```bash
time-cli pay-request "timecoin:TIME0AsqaMhk...?amount=50&pubkey=a1b2c3...&memo=Invoice%20%2342"
time-cli pay-request "timecoin:TIME0AsqaMhk...?amount=50&pubkey=a1b2c3..." --memo "Custom note"
```
Parse a payment request URI and send the specified amount with an encrypted memo. If the URI contains a memo, it is used automatically. Use `--memo` to override with your own message.

#### Wallet Notes

- All amounts are in TIME (the base unit)
- Transactions achieve instant finality via TimeVote consensus
- Minimum transaction fee: 0.01 TIME (flat floor; tiered % applies for larger amounts)
- Minimum send amount: 1 TIME (non-self-sends only)
- UTXOs are locked during transaction processing; rejected transactions unlock UTXOs automatically
- Testnet addresses start with `TIME0`; mainnet addresses start with `TIME1`

---

### Daemon Control

#### Get Uptime
```bash
time-cli uptime
```
Returns daemon uptime in seconds.

#### Stop Daemon
```bash
time-cli stop
```
Stops the daemon gracefully.

---

### Chain Maintenance & Recovery

These commands are for operators who need to repair state or recover from a fork. All run against the **live daemon** via RPC.

#### Reindex (UTXO + Transaction Index)
```bash
time-cli reindex
```
Rebuilds the UTXO set and transaction index by replaying all blocks from genesis. Use this to fix stale balances after chain corruption. Runs synchronously — the CLI waits for completion.

```bash
time-cli reindextransactions
```
Rebuilds only the transaction index in the background (returns immediately).

#### Deep Fork Recovery
If a node is stuck on a minority fork more than 100 blocks deep, normal reorg logic is blocked by the finality guard. Use the two-step recovery sequence:

```bash
# Step 1 — clear the BFT finality lock
time-cli resetfinalitylock 0

# Step 2 — roll back to genesis and resync from whitelisted peers
time-cli resyncfromwhitelist 0
```

`resyncfromwhitelist` bypasses the MAX_REORG_DEPTH (100-block) limit and re-downloads the canonical chain from trusted peers. Requires at least one whitelisted peer to be connected.

The `update.sh` script wraps this as a single command:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/update.sh resync           # both networks
sudo ./scripts/update.sh resync mainnet   # mainnet only
```

#### Full Chain Reset
```bash
time-cli rollbacktoblock0
```
**Danger.** Deletes all blocks above genesis, clears UTXOs, and resets chain height to 0. The node will re-download the entire chain from peers on restart. Use only when `resyncfromwhitelist` fails (e.g. no whitelisted peers reachable).

#### Rollback to Height
```bash
time-cli rollbacktoheight <height>
```
**Danger.** Rolls back the chain to a specific height (max 100 blocks, enforced by the finality guard). Use `resyncfromwhitelist` for deeper rollbacks.

---

### Memory Pool

#### Get Mempool Info
```bash
time-cli getmempoolinfo
```
Returns memory pool statistics.

#### Get Raw Mempool
```bash
time-cli getrawmempool
time-cli getrawmempool --verbose
```
Returns list of transactions in the memory pool.
