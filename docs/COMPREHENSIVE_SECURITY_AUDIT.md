2. **Vote signature completeness**: Require signatures on both Accept AND Reject votes for full audit trail
3. **Clock drift tracking**: Monitor producer timestamp accuracy over time
4. **Light client design**: Include AVS snapshot commitments in block headers when light clients are implemented

---

## 1. CONSENSUS-LAYER ATTACKS

### 1.1 ✅ 67% Attack (Supermajority Attack)
**Status:** **STRONGLY MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Attacker controls >67% of network resources to rewrite history.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **67% BFT-safe finality**: Requires 67%+ of active validator stake to finalize (tolerates up to 33% Byzantine)
- **Stake-weighted voting**: Must acquire supermajority of TIME collateral (expensive)
- **Cryptographic finality proofs**: Finalized blocks have verifiable signatures from 67%+ stake
- **Cannot rewrite finalized blocks**: Once TimeProof assembled, block is immutable
- **Liveness fallback**: If stalled >30s at 67%, threshold drops to 51% to prevent deadlock

**Attack Cost:** Would require acquiring >67% of all staked TIME coins (hundreds of millions in market cap)

**Code References:**
- `src/consensus.rs` - Finality weight threshold Q_finality = 67% (configurable)
- `src/block/types.rs:44-59` - TimeAttestation with witness signatures

---

### 1.2 ✅ Long-Range Attack
**Status:** **MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Attacker uses old private keys to rewrite chain history from genesis.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Checkpoints**: Hardcoded checkpoints in genesis prevent rewriting past certain heights
- **Finality proofs**: Historical TimeProofs make fork detection easy
- **Social consensus**: New nodes bootstrap from trusted checkpoints
- **AVS snapshots**: Validator set captured per slot prevents historical manipulation

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs:1732-1733` - Checkpoint validation
- `src/block/genesis.rs` - Dynamic genesis generation and verification

---

### 1.3 ✅ Nothing-at-Stake Attack / Vote Equivocation
**Status:** **MOSTLY MITIGATED - ENHANCEMENT RECOMMENDED**

**Attack:** Validators vote on multiple forks simultaneously (no cost to voting).

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Single chain finalization**: TimeVote protocol finalizes one chain at a time
- **Fork choice rule**: Prefer chain with most finalized blocks (TimeProofs)
- **BFT consensus**: Requires 67% to finalize, can't finalize conflicting blocks
- **Deterministic leader selection**: All honest nodes agree on next block producer
- **Signature binding**: Votes sign specific block_hash + slot, can't reuse

**⚠️ Enhancement - Vote Signature Completeness:**
Current implementation: Accept votes are signed, Reject votes may not be signed.

**Recommendation for stronger Byzantine fault tolerance:**
```rust
// Require signatures on ALL votes (Accept AND Reject)
pub struct VoteResponse {
    decision: Accept | Reject,
    signature: Signature,  // REQUIRED for both (not just Accept)
    voter_mn_id: String,
    voter_weight: u64,
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Creates cryptographic audit trail of all voting decisions
- Prevents validators from denying they rejected a block
- Enables detection and proof of equivocation (voting for conflicting blocks)
- Strengthens BFT security model

**Code References:**
- `src/consensus.rs:1064-1097` - Prepare vote generation
- `src/consensus.rs:1111-1148` - Precommit vote with block_hash binding

---

### 1.4 ✅ Selfish Mining
**Status:** **MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Miner withholds valid blocks to gain advantage on next block.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Time-scheduled slots**: Blocks produced at fixed 10-minute intervals
- **Deterministic leader selection**: Next leader is known, can't "race" for advantage
- **No PoW mining**: Block production isn't competitive (no mining reward advantage)
- **Immediate broadcast**: Blocks must be broadcast for voting (can't hide)
- **TimeVote finality**: Must accumulate votes from 67% stake to finalize

**Code References:**
- `src/timelock.rs` - Deterministic slot-based leader selection (TimeLock protocol)
- `src/block/vrf.rs` - VRF leader sortition
- `src/main.rs:1326-1440` - Block production and immediate broadcast

---

### 1.5 ⚠️ Stake Grinding / VRF Manipulation
**Status:** **MOSTLY MITIGATED - ENHANCEMENT RECOMMENDED**

**Attack:** Manipulate randomness source to predict/influence future leader selection.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- ✅ **VRF-based leader selection**: ECVRF (Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function) implemented
- ✅ **Cryptographic randomness**: VRF output unpredictable without knowing private key
- ✅ **Verifiable fairness**: VRF proof allows anyone to verify leader selection was fair
- ✅ **Chain head dependency**: VRF input includes previous block hash
- ✅ **No manipulation**: Cannot predict VRF output without producing valid block first

**⚠️ Potential Enhancement - VRF Pre-computation:**
Current VRF input: `prev_block_hash || slot_time || chain_id`
- `slot_time` is predictable (wall clock), allowing pre-computation of future slots
- Attacker with many masternodes could pre-compute winning slots days in advance

**Recommended Enhancement:**
```rust
// Add unpredictable entropy to VRF input
vrf_input = H(
    prev_block_hash ||           // Unpredictable
    slot_time ||                 // Predictable
    chain_id ||                  // Fixed
    last_finalized_tx_hash       // ADD: Recent unpredictable entropy
)
```
This limits pre-computation to 1-2 slots ahead while maintaining determinism.

**Code References:**
- `src/block/vrf.rs` - VRF input construction (ECVRF per RFC 9381)
- Uses ed25519-dalek for ECVRF implementation

---

### 1.6 ✅ Timestamping Attacks
**Status:** **MITIGATED (2106-SAFE)**

**Attack:** Manipulate block timestamps to gain consensus advantage.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Timestamp validation**: Blocks rejected if timestamp too far in past/future
- **Tolerance window**: ±5 seconds future (`TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SECS = 5` in `src/constants.rs`); blocks claiming a future timestamp are rejected immediately
- **Deterministic slot times**: Block timestamps expected at slot_time = genesis + (slot × 600); blocks produced more than 30s early are rejected for recent heights
- **Verification**: Nodes reject blocks with timestamps deviating from expected slot time
- 🟢 **2106-safe**: Uses `i64` timestamps throughout (no uint32 overflow issues like Bitcoin)

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs` - `validate_block()` (future-timestamp rejection) and `add_block()` (past-timestamp gating)
- `src/constants.rs:63` - `TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SECS = 5`
- `src/timelock.rs` - Slot time calculation (genesis + height × 600)
- `src/block/types.rs` - Block header timestamp field

**Limits:** Timestamps can vary within ±10 minutes, but doesn't affect consensus security.

**⚠️ Future Enhancement - Clock Drift Tracking:**
Consider tracking producer timestamp accuracy over time:
```rust
// Track persistent clock drift per producer
producer_drift_history: HashMap<MnId, Vec<i64>>
// Penalize producers with consistent >3s average drift
```

---

### 1.7 ✅ Eclipse Attack on Consensus
**Status:** **MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Isolate a node to show them a fake chain.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Multiple peer sources**: API discovery + bootstrap peers + peer exchange
- **Peer diversity**: Epsilon-greedy selection (90% best, 10% random)
- **Chain tip comparison**: Queries multiple peers for chain head
- **Fork detection**: AI-powered consensus health monitoring
- **Masternode connections**: Reserved slots for whitelisted masternodes

**Code References:**
- `src/ai/peer_selector.rs` - Epsilon-greedy peer diversity and multi-dimensional scoring
- `src/network/peer_scoring.rs` - Per-peer quality scoring
- `src/main.rs:1331-1380` - Multi-peer chain tip verification

---

## 2. NETWORK-LAYER ATTACKS

### 2.1 ✅ Sybil Attack
**Status:** **STRONGLY MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Create many fake identities to overwhelm network.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Connection limits**: Max 3 connections per IP address
- **Rate limiting**: 10 new connections per minute
- **Behavioral scoring**: Anomaly detection tracks peer behavior
- **Masternode collateral**: Block production requires stake (1,000-100,000 TIME)
- **IP-based reputation**: Persistent peer quality tracking
- **Automatic banning**: Malicious peers banned after 3-10 violations

**Code References:**
- `src/network/connection_manager.rs:232-242` - Per-IP connection limits
- `src/ai/anomaly_detector.rs` - Z-score anomaly detection on network events
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` - Sybil/eclipse/fork bombing detection with auto-ban enforcement
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` - Tier collateral requirements

---

### 2.1a ✅ Collateral Anchor Squatting
**Status:** **MITIGATED** (commit `6e6d14e` — 2026-04-06)

**Attack:** Attacker monitors the mempool for a new collateral UTXO (e.g. a Silver
send-to-self from `188.166.243.108`), then gossips a `MasternodeAnnouncement` claiming
that TXID before the legitimate node can announce itself. The attacker's IP is anchored
first and the legitimate owner is permanently locked out.

**Root cause:** Gossip announcements are self-reported — any node can claim any UTXO
outpoint, and the first-claim anchor in sled was permanent. The `wallet_address` field
was unverifiable because it came from the announcement message itself.

**TimeCoin Protection (V4 collateral proof):**
- On startup, the masternode daemon signs `"TIME_COLLATERAL_CLAIM:<txid>:<vout>"` with
  `masternodeprivkey` (from `time.conf`) and broadcasts `MasternodeAnnouncementV4`
  with the signature in `collateral_proof`.
- When a conflict is detected (another IP holds the collateral lock), two conditions
  are tested:
  1. The proof signature verifies against the announcing node's own `public_key` over
     the exact UTXO outpoint — binding this masternode key to this UTXO.
  2. `reward_address == utxo.address` — the announced reward address matches the
     on-chain (immutable) address of the collateral UTXO. Since operators configure
     `reward_address` in `time.conf` to the same address as the collateral UTXO
     output address, this is always true for the legitimate owner.
- If both conditions pass: squatter evicted (lock released, registry entry removed),
  legitimate owner registered.
- **No GUI wallet changes required** — `masternodeprivkey` and the outpoint in
  `masternode.conf` are sufficient. The proof is generated and broadcast automatically.

**Attack economics under the new scheme:**
- To pass condition (1): attacker needs the victim's `masternodeprivkey` — not feasible.
- To pass condition (2) with their own key: attacker sets `reward_address = victim's address`,
  meaning all rewards go to the victim's wallet. No financial upside.
- V4-vs-V4 race: attacker must continuously re-squat (every 60 s) while donating
  all rewards to the victim — economically irrational.

- `src/main.rs` - V4 announcement signing in announcement task

---

### 2.2 ✅ DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
**Status:** **STRONGLY MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Flood network with requests to exhaust resources.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Per-peer rate limits**:
  - TX: 50/sec
  - Blocks: 10/sec
  - UTXO queries: 100/sec
  - Votes: 100/sec
  - Ping: 2/10sec
- **Memory hard caps**: 50,000 rate limit entries (~2.4MB max)
- **Connection limits**: 125 total connections (100 inbound, 25 outbound)
- **Emergency cleanup**: Automatic entry eviction when approaching limits
- **Graduated banning**: Auto-ban after repeated violations

**Code References:**
- `src/network/rate_limiter.rs:35-60` - Per-message rate limits
- `src/network/rate_limiter.rs:173-201` - Memory protection

---

### 2.3 ✅ Eclipse Attack (Network Isolation)
**Status:** **MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Surround node with attacker-controlled peers to isolate from network.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Diverse peer selection**: AI-based scoring on 5+ dimensions
- **Random exploration**: 10% of connections try new peers
- **Multiple connection sources**: API + bootstrap + peer exchange
- **Masternode slots**: 50/125 slots reserved for whitelisted nodes
- **Connection diversity**: Separate inbound/outbound limits

**Code References:**
- `src/ai/peer_selector.rs` - Multi-dimensional peer scoring
- `src/network/peer_scoring.rs` - Per-peer quality metrics
- `src/network/connection_manager.rs:178-202` - Connection slot management

---

### 2.4 ✅ BGP Hijacking / Routing Attacks
**Status:** **MITIGATED (TLS ENABLED BY DEFAULT)**

**Attack:** Hijack network routes to intercept/modify traffic.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- ✅ **Cryptographic message authentication**: Ed25519 signatures on all consensus messages
- ✅ **Block hash verification**: Tampering detected via SHA256 hashes
- ✅ **P2P redundancy**: Multiple peer connections reduce single-point failure
- ✅ **TLS integrated and enabled by default**: `enable_tls = true` in `SecurityConfig`; server wraps accepted connections via `tls.accept_server()`, client connects via `set_tls_config()`
- ✅ **Self-signed P2P certificates**: Auto-generated on first start via `TlsConfig::new_self_signed()`. Custom certs supported via `tls=` / `tlscert=` / `tlskey=` config keys.

**Current Status:** TLS is active on mainnet by default. Disable with `tls=0` in `time.conf` (for isolated testnets only).

**Code References:**
- `src/network/tls.rs` - TLS implementation (rustls)
- `src/network/server.rs:542-587` - TLS accept on inbound connections
- `src/main.rs:4460-4464` - TLS config wiring at daemon startup
- `src/config.rs:629` - `enable_tls: true` default

---

### 2.5 ✅ Message Replay Attacks
**Status:** **STRONGLY MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Replay old network messages to cause confusion.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Dual-window Bloom filters**: Time-windowed deduplication
  - Blocks: 5-minute rotation
  - Transactions: 10-minute rotation
- **Atomic rotation**: Prevents race conditions during filter refresh
- **Chain-ID binding**: Messages bound to specific chain (mainnet/testnet)
- **Slot-time binding**: Finality votes expire after slot
- **Memory-efficient**: ~125KB per 10k items

**Code References:**
- `src/network/dedup_filter.rs:43-88` - Dual-window deduplication
- `src/types.rs:268-298` - Chain-ID in signed messages

---

### 2.6 ⚠️ Light Client Security
**Status:** **TRUST MODEL NEEDS SPECIFICATION**

**Attack:** Malicious full node provides fake data to light client.

**Current Status:** Light client implementation not yet specified in protocol.

**Future Consideration - AVS Snapshot Verification:**
When light clients are implemented, they will need to verify AVS snapshots used in TimeProof validation.

**Recommended Approach:**
```rust
// Include AVS snapshot commitment in block headers
pub struct BlockHeader {
    // ... existing fields ...
    avs_snapshot_root: Hash256,  // Merkle root of AVS composition
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Light clients can cryptographically verify AVS snapshots
- Query multiple nodes and compare against header commitment
- No trust assumption on individual full nodes (except for availability)
- Prevents fake TimeProof attacks

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Address when light client protocol is designed

**Code References:**
- Protocol Specification §21 (if exists) - Light client design
- `src/block/types.rs` - BlockHeader structure

---

## 3. TRANSACTION-LAYER ATTACKS

### 3.1 ✅ Double-Spend Attack
**Status:** **STRONGLY MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Spend same UTXO twice in different transactions.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **UTXO locking**: Atomic lock with 10-minute timeout
- **State machine**: Unspent → Locked → SpentPending → SpentFinalized → Archived
- **Lock conflict detection**: Second transaction automatically rejected
- **Mempool deduplication**: Same transaction can't enter mempool twice
- **Block validation**: Checks for double-spends within block
- **Permanent tombstone (v1.5.0+)**: Once spent, an outpoint is recorded in a sled-persisted `spent_tombstones` set. `add_utxo` hard-rejects any attempt to re-add it, even after `utxo_states` is cleared or the node restarts. See AV52.

**Code References:**
- `src/utxo_manager.rs` — `add_utxo()` tombstone check; `record_spent()`; `enable_spent_persistence()`
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — Pre-vote double-spend check

---

### 3.2 ✅ Transaction Malleability
**Status:** **NOT APPLICABLE (DESIGN PREVENTS)**

**Attack:** Modify transaction ID without invalidating signature.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Ed25519 signatures**: Fixed 64-byte signatures (not malleable)
- **Signature covers entire TX**: Signs `SHA256(txid || input_index || outputs_hash)`
- **TXID = SHA256(tx)**: Any modification changes TXID and breaks signature
- **No script malleability**: Simple script_pubkey (no complex opcodes)

**Code References:**
- `src/consensus.rs:1439-1466` - Signature message creation
- `src/transaction.rs:112-123` - TXID calculation

---

### 3.3 ✅ Fee Sniping / Replace-by-Fee (RBF) Attacks
**Status:** **NOT APPLICABLE (NO RBF)**

**Attack:** Replace low-fee transaction with higher-fee version to double-spend.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **No RBF support**: First valid transaction locks UTXOs
- **Locked UTXOs can't be respent**: Second transaction rejected immediately
- **Mempool immutability**: Once in mempool, transaction can't be replaced
- **Minimum fees enforced**: 1,000 satoshis absolute + 0.1% proportional

**Code References:**
- `src/utxo_manager.rs:179-227` - UTXO locking prevents replacement
- `src/consensus.rs:1396-1416` - Fee validation

---

### 3.4 ✅ Dust Attacks
**Status:** **MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Create many tiny UTXOs to bloat UTXO set.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Dust threshold**: 546 satoshi minimum output (0.00000546 TIME)
- **Proportional fees**: 0.1% fee makes dust transactions expensive
- **Economic infeasibility**: Spamming dust costs 0.1% per transaction
- **Mempool limits**: 100MB cap + LRU eviction

**Code References:**
- `src/consensus.rs:1386-1393` - Dust rejection
- `src/consensus.rs:1408-1416` - Proportional fee requirement

---

### 3.5 ✅ Front-Running
**Status:** **LIMITED (INHERENT TO TRANSPARENT MEMPOOLS)**

**Attack:** See pending transaction and submit competing transaction with higher fee.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- ⚠️ **Mempool visible**: Pending transactions broadcast to network
- ✅ **UTXO locking**: First transaction to lock UTXO wins
- ✅ **No RBF**: Can't replace transaction with higher-fee version
- ✅ **Deterministic block inclusion**: Leader can't easily exclude transactions
- ✅ **10-minute blocks**: Less time-sensitive than fast chains

**Inherent Limitation:** Transparent mempool allows MEV (Miner Extractable Value).

**Potential Enhancement:** Add private mempool or commit-reveal schemes for sensitive transactions.

**Code References:**
- `src/transaction_pool.rs:169-193` - Mempool transaction management

---

### 3.6 ✅ Signature Forgery
**Status:** **CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY IMPOSSIBLE**

**Attack:** Forge valid signatures to spend others' UTXOs.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Ed25519 cryptography**: Industry-standard, 128-bit security level
- **Full signature verification**: Every input signature checked
- **Public key in UTXO**: script_pubkey contains 32-byte Ed25519 public key
- **Message binding**: Signature covers txid + input_index + outputs_hash

**Code References:**
- `src/consensus.rs:1468-1538` - Ed25519 signature verification
- Dependencies: `ed25519-dalek = "2.1.1"` (audited library)

---

## 4. BLOCK PRODUCTION ATTACKS

### 4.1 ✅ JUST FIXED: Invalid Block Consensus
**Status:** **FIXED (January 19, 2026)**

**Attack:** Propose blocks with invalid transactions/UTXOs to disrupt network.

**Previous Vulnerability:** Nodes voted on blocks before validating transactions.

**Current Protection (NEW):**
- ✅ **Pre-vote validation**: All blocks validated BEFORE voting
- ✅ **Transaction signature checks**: Every TX verified before vote
- ✅ **UTXO existence checks**: Inputs must exist before vote
- ✅ **Block reward validation**: Coinbase + distribution checked before vote
- ✅ **Double-spend detection**: Within-block conflicts detected before vote
- ✅ **Merkle root validation**: Validated before vote

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message_handler.rs:2187-2291` - Pre-vote validation (NEW)
- `src/network/message_handler.rs:2293-2362` - Block reward structure validation (NEW)

---

### 4.2 ✅ Block Withholding
**Status:** **MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Leader produces block but doesn't broadcast to gain advantage.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Deterministic slots**: Next leader known, no advantage to withholding
- **Voting required**: Must broadcast to accumulate votes for finalization
- **Backup leaders**: If primary offline, backup leader triggers after 5 seconds
- **Liveness timeout**: After 30 seconds, TimeGuard protocol forces resolution
- **No mining rewards**: Can't "mine ahead" like PoW

**Code References:**
- `src/main.rs:1326-1440` - Block production and broadcast
- `src/timelock.rs` - Backup leader fallback (TimeGuard protocol)

---

### 4.3 ✅ JUST FIXED: Double Block Rewards
**Status:** **FIXED (January 19, 2026)**

**Attack:** Claim block rewards multiple times per block.

**Previous Vulnerability:** Block rewards added as both metadata AND transaction outputs.

**Current Protection (NEW):**
- ✅ **Single reward source**: Only reward_distribution transaction creates UTXOs
- ✅ **Validation**: Coinbase must create exactly BLOCK_REWARD_SATOSHIS
- ✅ **Distribution validation**: Outputs must match masternode_rewards metadata
- ✅ **No duplicate UTXOs**: masternode_rewards array is metadata only
- ✅ **Total amount check**: Distributed amount must equal block_reward

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs:2285-2429` - Block reward validation (NEW)
- `src/blockchain.rs:2160-2250` - UTXO processing (masternode_rewards not processed)

---

## 5. CRYPTOGRAPHIC ATTACKS

### 5.1 ✅ Hash Collision Attacks
**Status:** **CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE**

**Attack:** Find two inputs that produce same hash to forge blocks/transactions.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **SHA256 everywhere**: 2^256 hash space (collision-resistant)
- **Ed25519 hashing**: SHA512 internally (stronger than SHA256)
- **Merkle tree integrity**: Would require 2^256 operations to forge
- **Block hash binding**: Signatures cover block_hash (collision would break chain)

**Code References:**
- `src/block/types.rs:101-111` - Block hash calculation (SHA256)
- `src/transaction.rs:112-123` - TXID calculation (SHA256)

---

### 5.2 ✅ Quantum Computing Attacks
**Status:** **VULNERABLE TO FUTURE QUANTUM (INDUSTRY STANDARD)**

**Attack:** Use quantum computer to break Ed25519 signatures.

**Current Status:**
- ⚠️ **Ed25519 vulnerable to Shor's algorithm** (theoretical quantum attack)
- ⚠️ **SHA256 partially vulnerable** to Grover's algorithm (reduces security to 128-bit)
- ✅ **No quantum computers capable yet** (estimated 10-20 years away)

**Industry Context:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most cryptocurrencies use similar algorithms.

**Recommendation:** Monitor post-quantum cryptography research (e.g., NIST PQC finalists).

**Future Upgrade Path:** 
- Implement hybrid signatures (Ed25519 + Dilithium/SPHINCS+)
- Add post-quantum hash function (SHA3-256)

---

### 5.3 ✅ Replay Attacks (Cross-Chain)
**Status:** **MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Replay mainnet transaction on testnet or vice versa.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Chain-ID binding**: Signatures include chain_id (mainnet=1, testnet=2, devnet=3)
- **Different networks**: Separate genesis blocks, different ports
- **Signature domain separation**: VRF and finality votes include chain_id

**Code References:**
- `src/types.rs:268-298` - Chain-ID in SignedMessage
- `time.conf` (mainnet) vs `time.conf` (testnet) with `testnet=1` - Separate configurations

---

## 6. GOVERNANCE & SOCIAL ATTACKS

### 6.1 ✅ Governance Capture
**Status:** **PARTIALLY MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Wealthy entity buys stake to control governance votes.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Tier collateral requirements**: Minimum 1,000 TIME for Bronze tier voting
- **Stake-weighted voting**: Proportional to collateral (prevents Sybil)
- **Uptime requirements**: Must maintain 90%+ uptime to vote
- **Health AI monitoring**: Unhealthy nodes excluded from governance
- ⚠️ **Plutocracy risk**: Whales with Gold tier (100,000 TIME) have 100x vote weight

**Recommendation:** Consider quadratic voting or voting caps to limit whale influence.

**Code References:**
- `src/masternode_registry.rs:228-257` - Tier collateral requirements

---

### 6.2 ✅ Bribery / Vote Buying
**Status:** **MONITORING ONLY (HARD TO PREVENT)**

**Attack:** Bribe validators to vote certain way.

**Inherent Limitation:** Off-chain coordination difficult to prevent technically.

**TimeCoin Protections:**
- **Anonymous voting**: Votes signed but voter identity in pseudonymous (address-based)
- **Verifiable finality**: All votes public, can audit for suspicious patterns
- **Stake slashing potential**: Future upgrade could slash malicious voters

**Recommendation:** Implement reputation system and stake slashing for provable misbehavior.

---

## 7. ECONOMIC ATTACKS

### 7.1 ✅ Inflation Attacks
**Status:** **IMPOSSIBLE**

**Attack:** Create TIME coins from nothing.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Fixed block rewards**: 100 TIME per block, enforced in validation
- **Transaction balance check**: input_sum ≥ output_sum strictly enforced
- **No minting outside blocks**: Only coinbase can create new TIME
- **Block reward validation**: Enforced in both add_block() and pre-vote validation
- **UTXO set integrity**: Can calculate total supply by summing UTXO set

**Code References:**
- `src/consensus.rs:1418-1423` - Input ≥ output check
- `src/blockchain.rs:2285-2429` - Block reward validation

---

### 7.2 ✅ Deflationary Attacks (Lost Coins)
**Status:** **NOT AN ATTACK (ECONOMIC FEATURE)**

**Observation:** Coins sent to unspendable addresses are effectively burned.

**TimeCoin Behavior:**
- Lost coins remain in UTXO set but never spent
- Effective supply decreases over time (deflationary pressure)
- Not exploitable (attacker loses coins)

---

## 8. IMPLEMENTATION-LEVEL VULNERABILITIES

### 8.1 ✅ Memory Exhaustion
**Status:** **MITIGATED**

**Attack:** Exhaust node memory with large data structures.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Mempool cap**: 100MB total, 10,000 transaction limit
- **Rate limiter cap**: 50,000 entries (~2.4MB)
- **Block size limit**: 4MB maximum

### 8.3 ✅ Integer Overflow
**Status:** **PROTECTED (RUST DEBUG CHECKS)**

**Attack:** Overflow arithmetic to manipulate values.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Rust overflow checks**: Debug builds panic on overflow
- **Saturating arithmetic**: Uses `.saturating_sub()` and `.saturating_add()` where appropriate
- **Checked arithmetic**: Uses `.checked_add()` for critical paths
- **u64 for amounts**: 18.4 quintillion satoshis max (far exceeds supply)

## 9. AI-SPECIFIC ATTACKS (TIMECOIN-UNIQUE)

### 9.1 ✅ AI Consensus Health Manipulation
**Status:** **MONITORED**

**Attack:** Manipulate AI health predictions to exclude honest nodes.

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- **Multi-factor health scoring**: Response validity, fork attempts, request rate, timing
- **Weight distribution**: 40% validity, 30% forks, 20% rate, 10% timing
- **Threshold-based**: Requires 0.7+ score for "anomalous" classification
- **Gradual banning**: 3-10 violations before permanent ban
- **Whitelist bypass**: Masternodes can whitelist to skip AI checks

**Limitation:** AI model could have false positives/negatives.

**Recommendation:** Regular model retraining and adversarial testing.

## 10. SUPPLY CHAIN & DEPENDENCY ATTACKS

### 10.1 ⚠️ Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Status:** **REQUIRES REGULAR AUDITING**

**Risk:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (e.g., ed25519-dalek, tokio, sled).

**TimeCoin Protection:**
- ✅ **Rust's cargo ecosystem**: Cryptographically verified dependencies
- ✅ **Well-audited libraries**: Using mainstream crates (tokio, serde, ed25519-dalek)
- ⚠️ **Manual review needed**: Should regularly audit dependencies

**Recommendation:**
- Run `cargo audit` regularly
- Subscribe to RustSec advisories
- Consider cargo-deny for policy enforcement

**Code References:**
- `Cargo.toml` - All dependencies listed

## 11. RPC API ATTACKS

*Added: March 2026 — covers the RPC attack surface not addressed in the original audit.*

### 11.1 ✅ FIXED — RPC Exposed to Public Internet
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.2.0**

**Risk:** RPC server was bound to `0.0.0.0`, allowing any internet host to execute wallet-draining commands (`sendtoaddress`, `sendfrom`, `sendrawtransaction`).

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Default bind changed to `127.0.0.1`** in both code (`config.rs`) and install script
- ✅ **Install script no longer sets `rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0`**

**Code References:**
- `src/config.rs` — `RpcConfig` default `listen_address`
- `scripts/install-masternode.sh` — config generation

### 11.2 ✅ FIXED — No RPC Authentication
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.2.0**

**Risk:** RPC server accepted all requests without any authentication. Any local process could drain the wallet.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **HTTP Basic Auth** with `rpcuser`/`rpcpassword` in `time.conf`
- ✅ **Auto-generated credentials** on first run (16-char user, 32-char password)
- ✅ **`.cookie` file** written for CLI tool authentication (owner-read-only)
- ✅ **`time-cli` reads `.cookie`** automatically (also accepts `--rpcuser`/`--rpcpassword`)
- ✅ **Existing configs auto-upgraded** with generated credentials

**Code References:**
- `src/rpc/server.rs` — Basic Auth checking in `handle_connection()`
- `src/config.rs` — `RpcConfig.rpcuser`/`rpcpassword`, `write_rpc_cookie()`
- `src/bin/time-cli.rs` — `read_cookie_file()`, `read_conf_credentials()`

### 11.3 ✅ FIXED — No RPC Rate Limiting
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.2.0**

**Risk:** No rate limiting on RPC allowed resource exhaustion via rapid-fire requests.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Per-IP rate limiter** (100 requests/second) in RPC server
- ✅ **429 Too Many Requests** response when exceeded
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** of stale entries every 60 seconds

**Code References:**
- `src/rpc/server.rs` — `RpcRateLimiter` struct

### 11.4 ✅ FIXED — CORS Allows All Origins
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.2.0**

**Risk:** Default `allow_origins: ["*"]` could enable cross-origin attacks if RPC were exposed.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Default restricted** to `["http://localhost", "http://127.0.0.1"]`

**Code References:**
- `src/config.rs` — `RpcConfig` default `allow_origins`

### 11.5 ✅ FIXED — RPC Credentials Stored in Plaintext
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.2.0**

**Risk:** `rpcuser`/`rpcpassword` stored in cleartext in `time.conf` could be read by any process with file access.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **`rpcauth` hashed credentials** — Bitcoin Core-compatible format `rpcauth=user:salt$hash`
- ✅ **HMAC-SHA256** verification (password never stored, only hash)
- ✅ **Multiple `rpcauth` entries** supported for multi-user setups
- ✅ **Generator script** at `scripts/rpcauth.py` for creating hashed credentials
- ✅ **Backward compatible** — plaintext `rpcuser`/`rpcpassword` still works for simplicity

**Code References:**
- `src/rpc/server.rs` — `RpcAuthenticator` with `RpcAuthEntry` hashed credential support
- `src/config.rs` — `RpcConfig.rpcauth` field, parsed from `time.conf`
- `scripts/rpcauth.py` — HMAC-SHA256 credential generator

### 11.6 ✅ FIXED — No TLS for RPC
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.2.0**

**Risk:** RPC over plain HTTP exposes credentials and wallet commands to interception on the local machine or network.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Optional TLS** via `rpctls=1` in `time.conf`
- ✅ **Auto-generated self-signed certificate** when no cert/key files specified
- ✅ **Custom certificate support** via `rpctlscert`/`rpctlskey` config options
- ✅ **Reuses existing TLS infrastructure** from `src/network/tls.rs` (rustls)
- ✅ **Graceful fallback** — if TLS init fails, server falls back to plain HTTP with warning

**Code References:**
- `src/rpc/server.rs` — `set_tls()`, TLS accept in `run()` loop
- `src/main.rs` — TLS config loading and `TlsConfig` integration
- `src/config.rs` — `rpctls`, `rpctlscert`, `rpctlskey` fields

## 12. WALLET SECURITY

*Added: March 2026*

### 12.1 ✅ FIXED — Hardcoded Default Wallet Password
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.2.0**

**Risk:** Wallet encrypted with AES-256-GCM (strong) but default password was hardcoded as `"timecoin"` — trivially guessable.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Auto-generated 32-char random password** on first wallet creation
- ✅ **Password stored in `.wallet_password`** (owner-read-only permissions)
- ✅ **Legacy wallet migration**: existing wallets re-encrypted with new password on first load
- ✅ **Hardcoded password removed** from production path

**Code References:**
- `src/wallet.rs` — `WalletManager::resolve_password()`, `save_password_file()`

---

## 13. MESSAGE SIGNING ENFORCEMENT

*Added: March 2026*

### 13.1 ✅ FIXED — Unsigned Vote Acceptance
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.2.0**

**Risk:** TimeVote messages accepted empty signatures for "backward compatibility" and also accepted votes from unknown/unregistered masternodes, allowing vote forgery.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Empty signatures rejected** with warning log
- ✅ **Unknown voter votes rejected** (must be registered masternode)

**Remaining Work:**
- ⚠️ General network messages (Ping, BlockAnnouncement, TransactionBroadcast, etc.) still unsigned — `SignedMessage` wrapper exists but is not used in the wire protocol
- **Recommendation:** Introduce a protocol version bump that requires `SignedMessage` wrapping for all message types

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — `verify_vote_signature()`
- `src/network/signed_message.rs` — `SignedMessage` struct (available but unused for non-vote messages)

## 14. APRIL 2026 MAINNET ATTACK FINDINGS

*Added: April 7, 2026 — Observations from live mainnet attacks across LW-Michigan2, LW-Arizona, and DO-Singapore nodes.*

---

### 14.1 ✅ FIXED — Sybil Subnet Attack (`154.217.246.0/24`)
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.34** (commit d8ac235)

**Attack:** A coordinated Sybil network of 15+ IP addresses from the `154.217.246.0/24` subnet repeatedly sent `MasternodeAnnouncement` messages claiming ownership of legitimate masternodes' collateral UTXOs. The attack generated 200–300 "Registry conflict" log lines per 2-second window with **zero penalty** — pure noise that masked real events in the log and consumed CPU/IO.

**Observed Behavior:**
- IPs involved: `154.217.246.19`, `.33`, `.34`, `.48`, `.67`, `.86`, `.105`, `.111`, `.130`, `.181`, `.187`, `.194`
- All claiming outpoints anchored to legitimate nodes (e.g., `96d12d31...`, `45d22fd2...`, `0d16a18c...`)
- `154.217.246.33` additionally operated as a pre-handshake prober (sending data before completing the handshake)
- Free-tier nodes from the subnet performed rapid IP migrations to steal collateral, cycling between registrations

**Root Cause:** The "Registry conflict" code path (`message_handler.rs` around the `can_evict == false` branch) had no rate limiting and recorded zero violations — attackers could spam it indefinitely at no cost.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Rate-limited WARN** to once per 5 minutes per peer IP (prevents log flooding)
- ✅ **`record_violation()` on every rejection** — peer gets auto-banned after repeated attempts (3 violations → 1 min, 5 → 5 min, 10 → permanent)
- ✅ **Coordinated /24 Sybil auto-detection** — if ≥5 unique IPs from the same /24 subnet claim the same collateral outpoint within 60 seconds, the entire /24 is automatically subnet-banned
- ✅ **`bansubnet=` config option** — operators can statically ban entire CIDR ranges in `time.conf` (e.g., `bansubnet=154.217.246.0/24`); bans are enforced at the TCP accept level before any handshake

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — Registry conflict path with rate limiting, violation recording, and Sybil auto-detection
- `src/network/banlist.rs` — `add_subnet_ban()`, `in_banned_subnet()`, `subnet_ban_count()`
- `src/config.rs` — `banned_subnets` field; `bansubnet=` parser
- `src/network/server.rs` — Subnet ban enforcement at TCP accept; `new_with_banlist()` subnet init loop

---

### 14.2 ✅ FIXED — Pre-Handshake Prober Attack
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.34** (commit 948041f)

**Attack:** Nodes (notably `154.217.246.33`, `43.129.27.42`, `8.218.124.20`, `39.174.152.101`, `104.28.165.55`) connected every ~30 seconds and sent protocol data **before completing the handshake** (before the Handshake message exchange). This is a probing/fingerprinting technique and a resource exhaustion vector.

**Observed Behavior (live logs):**
```
⚠️  154.217.246.33:59680 sent message before handshake - closing connection
⚠️  Violation #5 from 154.217.246.33: Sent message before completing handshake
🚫 Auto-banned 154.217.246.33 for 5 minutes (5 violations)
```

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **`banlist.record_violation()` called immediately** on every pre-handshake message (in addition to AI detection)
- ✅ **Auto-banned** after 5 violations (5-minute ban); permanent after 10

**Code References:**
- `src/network/server.rs` — Pre-handshake violation handler (`record_violation()` on early message)
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `record_pre_handshake_violation()`; ≥10 violations → `BlockPeer`

---

### 14.3 ✅ FIXED — Collateral Hijack / Free-Tier Squatting Attack
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.34** (commits 948041f, d8ac235)

**Attack:** Two variants were observed:

**Variant A — Free-tier squatting on paid-tier collateral:** Nodes (`154.217.246.187`, `47.79.37.107`, `154.217.246.67`) repeatedly attempted to claim UTXOs belonging to paid Silver/Bronze masternodes (`165.84.215.117`, `64.91.224.76`) via gossip announcements. These attempts generated "Free-tier claim rejected" messages at 20+ per second with no per-IP penalty.

**Variant B — Direct collateral hijack:** `47.79.39.125` (DO-Singapore) and `69.167.169.81` attempted to claim Silver-tier collateral UTXOs (`a579a134...`, `0d16a18c...`) belonging to other nodes, with no matching UTXO address proof.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **`record_severe_violation()` on `CollateralAlreadyLocked`** — covers both free-tier rejection and hijack rejection paths (both return this error). First severe violation → 1-hour ban; second → permanent ban.
- ✅ **`record_collateral_spoof_attempt()` in AI detector** — feeds attack pattern into coordinated detection

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — `CollateralAlreadyLocked` handlers for paid-tier and free-tier paths (lines ~3776 and ~3857)
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `record_collateral_spoof_attempt()`
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `Free-tier claim rejected` and `Collateral hijack rejected` paths (both return `CollateralAlreadyLocked`)

---

### 14.4 ✅ FIXED — GossipEvictionStorm Attack
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.3.x** (pre-existing fix, observed working correctly in April 2026 logs)

**Attack:** `69.167.168.176` triggered a `GossipEvictionStorm` — rapidly broadcasting masternode announcements to evict legitimate nodes from the registry by cycling through their collateral outpoints. This is a variant of the V4 eviction abuse.

**Observed Behavior (live logs):**
```
Peer 69.167.168.176 is banned: Temporarily banned for 3416s: SEVERE: GossipEvictionStorm
[Outbound] REJECTING message from banned peer 69.167.168.176
```
The node kept attempting to reconnect but was correctly rejected every time.

**Fix Status:** Existing AI eviction storm detector is working. The 3416-second ban correctly persisted across reconnection attempts.

**Code References:**
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `GossipEvictionStorm` attack type
- `src/network/server.rs` — Banlist check at TCP accept and outbound message receipt

---

### 14.5 ✅ FIXED — Oversized Frame (Memory Exhaustion) Attack
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.34** (commit pending in server.rs)

**Attack:** A peer sent a TCP frame with a 4-byte length header claiming a body size of **2,823,396,163 bytes (~2.8 GB)**. Since only 4 bytes need to be sent (the length prefix), this is a trivially cheap attack. The previous code caught the oversize and disconnected the peer, but recorded **zero violation** — the attacker could reconnect and repeat indefinitely at no cost.

**Observed (live log, line 373):**
```
Connection from 188.166.243.108:60880 ended: Frame too large: 2823396163 bytes (max: 8388608)
```

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **`banlist.record_violation()` on "Frame too large" error** — attacker is penalized: 3 oversized frames → 1-minute ban, 5 → 5-minute ban, 10 → permanent ban

**Note:** In the observed instance, `188.166.243.108` is a legitimate node running an outdated binary with a serialization bug (not a malicious attacker). The fix is still correct: whitelisted IPs bypass the banlist check, so the operator's own node will not be penalized.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/server.rs` — `Err(e)` branch in message read loop; `record_violation()` when `e.contains("Frame too large")`
- `src/network/wire.rs` — `read_message()`: frame size check against `MAX_FRAME_SIZE` (8 MB)

---

### 14.6 ✅ FIXED — UTXO Lock Flood Attack
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.33** (commit 3c8bc59)

**Attack:** A peer sent an abnormally high number of `UTXOStateUpdate(Locked)` messages for the same transaction — far exceeding the number of inputs any legitimate transaction would have. This is a resource exhaustion attack targeting the UTXO manager lock/unlock machinery.

**Attack Source:** `47.79.39.125`, `188.166.243.108` (old binary bug)

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Per-connection per-TX UTXO lock counter** — max 50 lock messages per TX per connection
- ✅ **AI auto-ban** via `record_utxo_lock_flood()` when threshold exceeded
- ✅ **"Applied UTXO lock" logs downgraded** INFO → DEBUG to reduce log noise from legitimate traffic

**Code References:**
- `src/network/server.rs` — `peer_tx_lock_counts` HashMap; `MAX_UTXO_LOCKS_PER_TX = 50`
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `UtxoLockFlood` attack type; `record_utxo_lock_flood()`

---

### 14.7 ✅ FIXED — V4 Eviction Oscillation / IP Cycling (Free-tier Re-squatting)
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.34** (commits `1b9bf31`, `a028b52`, `651799c`)

**Attack:** After a legitimate node uses a V4 collateral proof to evict a free-tier squatter, the squatter immediately re-registers via "free-tier IP migration" from a different IP in the same Sybil subnet. This creates an oscillation loop:

1. `154.217.246.19` squats on `96d12d31...` (registered to `188.166.243.108`)
2. `188.166.243.108` presents V4 proof → evicts squatter ✅
3. V4 eviction storm cooldown prevents rapid re-eviction
4. `154.217.246.19` re-migrates collateral from yet another squatter
5. Repeat

**Observed (live log):**
```
✅ V4 collateral proof verified: evicting squatter 154.217.246.19 → 188.166.243.108 for 96d12d31...
🛡️ V4 eviction storm blocked for 96d12d31... (154.217.246.19 → 154.217.246.194) — cooldown active
🔄 Free-tier IP migration: 96d12d31... moving from 154.217.246.19 to 69.167.169.81
```

**Current Mitigation:** Subnet ban of `154.217.246.0/24` (auto-triggered or manually via `bansubnet=`) stops the migration at the TCP level. With v1.4.34, these IPs accumulate violations faster and reach permanent ban sooner.

**Fixes Applied (v1.4.34):**
- ✅ **`MIGRATION_COOLDOWN_SECS` raised 60s → 300s** — reduces cycling frequency by 5×; attacker can no longer flip on every block slot
- ✅ **Back-and-forth cycling detection** — new `collateral_migration_from` field tracks the source IP of the last accepted migration per outpoint. If the incoming IP matches the previous-from IP within `CYCLING_LOCKOUT_SECS = 600`, the migration is rejected as AV3.
- ✅ **`record_synchronized_disconnect()`** — if ≥5 masternodes from the same /24 disconnect within 30s, the specific offending IP is blocked (not the whole subnet, to avoid collateral damage to legitimate cloud-hosted nodes)

**Code References:**
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `MIGRATION_COOLDOWN_SECS = 300`; `collateral_migration_from` field; cycling detection before `collateral_migration_times.insert()`
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `record_synchronized_disconnect()`; `SynchronizedCycling` attack type
- `src/network/server.rs` — `record_synchronized_disconnect()` called in `handle_peer` cleanup after `mark_inactive_on_disconnect`

---

### 14.8 ✅ FIXED — Ghost Connection OOM / Distributed SNI Flood
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.34** (commits `2778693`, `1affdfc`, `a028b52`)

**Attack:** A coordinated botnet sends ~10 TLS connections per second from distributed IPs. Each connection presents the victim node's own IP address as the TLS SNI hostname (e.g., `35302e32382e3130342e3530` = hex-encoded ASCII `50.28.104.50`). Each connection completes TLS successfully (rustls warns but proceeds) then never sends a Handshake message. The 10-second pre-handshake timeout holds every connection as a live tokio future.

**Crash Mechanism:** 10 connections/sec × 10s hold = ~100 concurrent futures × ~200KB TLS state = ~20MB RAM consumed every 10 seconds — growing until the kernel OOM-killer fires (~12 minutes).

**Compound effect (three vectors firing simultaneously):**
1. SNI ghost flood consuming ~20MB/10s
2. PHASE3 outbound loop wasting 15 tokio tasks on banned IPs every 30s (see 14.9)
3. Coordinated disconnect storm: 7–10 nodes from `154.217.246.x` disconnecting simultaneously every ~60s, triggering reconnect storms

**Observed:** All nodes (Michigan, Arizona) crashing every ~12 minutes. Watchdog restarted each node 8–9 times per session.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **`timed.service` memory limits** — `MemoryMax=3G`, `MemoryHigh=2G`, `LimitNPROC=8192`. Hard ceiling prevents OOM from killing other system processes; systemd restarts if limit is breached
- ✅ **Per-/24 subnet accept rate limiter** — >20 connections/min from any single /24 prefix are dropped before TLS. Implemented as `DashMap<String, VecDeque<Instant>>` in the TCP accept loop, before `can_accept_inbound()`. Non-whitelisted IPs only — trusted nodes bypass the limit.
- ✅ **`record_tls_failure()` AI hook** — rate-limit rejections feed the AI attack detector; ≥5 from same IP in 60s → `BlockPeer`
- ✅ **Watchdog RPC timeout** — `mn-watchdog.sh` wraps all `time-cli` calls with `timeout "$RPC_TIMEOUT"` (default 8s), preventing 60s stalls when the daemon is dead. `FAIL_THRESHOLD` default changed 1→3 to avoid restart thrashing on transient RPC errors.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/server.rs` — `subnet_accept_rate: Arc<DashMap<String, VecDeque<Instant>>>` in `run()`; subnet prefix check with `MAX_SUBNET_CONNECTS_PER_MIN = 20`
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `record_tls_failure()`; `TlsFlood` attack type; `tls_failure_times` sliding-window field
- `scripts/mn-watchdog.sh` — `--rpc-timeout` flag; `FAIL_THRESHOLD` default
- `timed.service` — `MemoryMax`, `MemoryHigh`, `LimitNPROC`

---

### 14.9 ✅ FIXED — PHASE3 Reconnect Loop to Banned Peers
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.34** (commit `a028b52`)

**Attack:** The PHASE3 outbound connection loop (`client.rs`) iterates all registered masternodes and peers every 30 seconds. The `should_skip()` closure only checked the static config `banned_peers` set — it did **not** check `res.ip_banlist`, the live `Arc<RwLock<IPBanlist>>` that holds subnet bans applied by the AI enforcement loop. As a result, the PHASE3 loop opened full TCP + TLS handshakes to all ~15 IPs on the banned `154.217.246.0/24` subnet on every 30-second cycle, consuming tokio tasks and TLS memory:

```
[PHASE3-MN] Connected to peer: 154.217.246.34:24000
[PHASE3-MN] REJECTING message from banned peer 154.217.246.34: Subnet banned
```

During the ghost connection OOM this contributed ~15 extra concurrent futures every 30 seconds.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Both PHASE3-MN and PHASE3-PEER loops check `ip_banlist.write().await.is_banned()` before `mark_connecting`. Banned IPs are skipped at zero cost — no socket opened, no TLS round-trip, no tokio task spawned.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/client.rs` — PHASE3-MN loop (~line 438); PHASE3-PEER loop (~line 519); `ip_banlist.write().await.is_banned()` check before `mark_connecting`

---

### 14.10 ✅ FIXED — IP Cycling / Collateral Migration Back-and-Forth
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.34** (commit `a028b52`)

**Attack:** Four attacker-controlled collateral outpoints were cycling between IP pairs on an exact 60-second cadence — matching the old `MIGRATION_COOLDOWN_SECS = 60`. Each cycle triggered UTXOManager stale-collateral unlocks, sled registry writes, and peer gossip re-broadcasts. With 4 outpoints cycling synchronously the registry received sustained write pressure and legitimate nodes flickered between active/inactive reward eligibility states.

**Observed IP pairs:**
| Outpoint prefix | Pair |
|-----------------|------|
| `50911bd...` | `154.217.246.34` ↔ `124.70.167.62` |
| `f52a81...`  | `154.217.246.111` ↔ `154.217.246.86` |
| `926b2f...`  | `133.18.180.117` ↔ `43.119.35.195` |
| `95f1b8...`  | `69.167.169.81` ↔ `47.82.236.153` |

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **Cooldown raised 60s → 300s** — each cycling event now costs the attacker 5× longer; the 4-outpoint synchronized cycle now fires at most every 5 minutes instead of every minute
- ✅ **Back-and-forth detection (600s lockout)** — `collateral_migration_from` field tracks last-from IP per outpoint; incoming migration rejected with `InvalidCollateral` if it matches the previous-from IP within 600 seconds
- ✅ **Subnet disconnect detection** — coordinated simultaneous disconnects from the same /24 trigger `BlockPeer` for the specific offending IP

**Note on subnet-wide bans:** The synchronized disconnect detector emits `BlockPeer` for the specific IP, not `BanSubnet` for the whole /24. This is intentional — cloud providers like Alibaba Cloud host both attacker and legitimate nodes on the same prefix. Operators who are certain a subnet is wholly hostile can add explicit `bansubnet=x.x.x.0/24` entries to `time.conf`.

**Code References:**
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `MIGRATION_COOLDOWN_SECS = 300`; `collateral_migration_from: Arc<DashMap<String, String>>`; cycling detection block before `collateral_migration_times.insert()`
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `record_synchronized_disconnect()`; `subnet_disconnects` sliding-window field; `SynchronizedCycling` → `BlockPeer`
- `src/network/server.rs` — `record_synchronized_disconnect()` call in `handle_peer` cleanup (gated on `handshake_done`)

### 14.11 ✅ FIXED — Reconnection-Storm Tokio Thread Starvation
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.4.35** (commit `22e056a`, April 8, 2026)

**Attack / Failure Mode:** When 40+ masternodes disconnect and reconnect simultaneously (due to a mass eviction from the Free-tier subnet flood, attacker-triggered disconnect storm, or a network partition resolving), each inbound reconnection spawns a TLS I/O bridge task plus a message-processing loop task. During the resulting burst:

- Each arriving message acquires a write lock on the **shared** `Arc<RwLock<RateLimiter>>` (one lock for ALL inbound connections)
- Ping/pong bursts from 15+ peers at ~3 pings/sec each = 45+ write-lock acquisitions per second on one mutex
- Fork-resolution state-machine runs concurrent `GetBlocks` cycles against the same peers
- All of the above on a 4-worker tokio runtime (pinned for sled-on-VPS safety)

Result: tokio worker threads saturate → RPC JSON-RPC handler never gets scheduled → `masternodestatus` RPC times out in 3s → watchdog calls it "de-registration" and restarts the node → **restart every ~10 minutes**.

## 15. ADDITIONAL MAINNET ATTACK FINDINGS (April–May 2026)

> **This section is the single source of truth for all known attack vectors.** When a new attack is identified (from live node logs, security review, or analysis), add it here immediately. `CLAUDE.md` contains only the developer workflow for responding to attacks — the canonical vector list lives here.

*Added: May 2026 — Vectors discovered or fixed after the April 7 mainnet incident. Sections 15.1+ cover pool/reward layer attacks, protocol logic bugs, and policy revisions.*

---

### 15.1 ✅ FIXED — Non-Deterministic Tier Sort (AV1)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — chain stall

**Attack:** When a masternode operator registers the same wallet address at multiple tiers (e.g., Silver at IP_A and Free at IP_B), `tier_for_wallet()` iterated a `HashMap` whose iteration order is non-deterministic across runs and machines. Different nodes classified the same wallet differently, causing block producer and some validators to agree while others disagreed → every proposal rejected → chain stall.

**Root Cause:** `tier_for_wallet()` used an unsorted map, yielding non-deterministic results on hash collision reordering.

**Fix Implemented:** All tier lookups now sort by collateral outpoint (highest tier wins in case of wallet overlap). The sort key is the full `txid:vout` string, giving a stable total order across all nodes.

**Code References:**
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `tier_for_wallet()` deterministic sort by collateral outpoint

---

### 15.2 ✅ FIXED — Reward Squatter / Free Pool Double-Payment (AV2)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — double-payment exploit

**Attack:** A node with a wallet address appearing in both a paid tier and the Free tier could extract a reward from both pools in the same block. The block producer included the address in the Silver (or Bronze/Gold) pool entry AND again in the Free-tier recipient list. Validators accepted because per-pool totals were correct.

**Root Cause:** Missing per-tier wallet exclusion: a wallet that received a paid-tier reward was not excluded from the Free pool selection in the same block.

**Fix Implemented:** `paid_tier_wallet_set` is built before Free-pool selection; any wallet already paid at Bronze/Silver/Gold tier is excluded from Free-tier recipients.

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs` — `paid_tier_wallet_set` exclusion in Free-tier pool selection

---

### 15.3 ✅ FIXED — Fee Validation False-Positive (AV5)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — 20-second chain stall per fee-bearing block

**Attack / Bug:** Any block containing transactions that paid fees was rejected by every validator, causing the block to be re-proposed by a different node 20 seconds later. This was not a deliberate attack but a latent protocol bug that an attacker could trigger by submitting fee-bearing transactions.

**Root Cause:** `validate_proposal_rewards()` passed a hardcoded `fees = 0` to its reward calculation. The block producer correctly included transaction fees in the coinbase; the validator computed a different expected reward → mismatch → rejection.

**Fix Implemented:** `compute_block_fees(block)` helper introduced; validators now pass the actual sum of transaction fees to `validate_proposal_rewards()`.

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs` — `compute_block_fees()`; `validate_proposal_rewards()` fee parameter

---

### 15.4 ✅ FIXED — Bitmap Position Drift (AV6)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — wrong reward recipients; false-positive reward-violation bans

**Attack:** Between block production and block validation, the active masternode set can change (a node connects or disconnects). Because reward-distribution bitmaps were keyed on volatile IP string positions, the producer and validator could assign different slot indices to the same node → validator saw mismatched recipients → false-positive `record_reward_violation()` → legitimate nodes accumulate bans.

**Root Cause:** Bitmap positions were derived from the sort order of `ip:port` strings, which changes whenever any node joins or leaves.

**Fix Implemented:** Each masternode is assigned a permanent `slot_id` at registration time. Bitmap positions are keyed on `slot_id` rather than IP. The `slot_id` is stable across all network topology changes, so producer and validator always agree on which bit maps to which node.

**Code References:**
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `slot_id` field assigned at `register()`; `bitmap_position_for()` uses `slot_id`

---

### 15.5 ✅ FIXED — Reward Hijack (AV7)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — theft of block rewards from legitimate participants

**Attack:** A modified block producer submitted blocks in which the reward outputs paid addresses not belonging to any active masternode (or paid the attacker's own address for tiers it had not earned). Validators accepted because the total coinbase amount was correct, not because the recipient identities were verified.

**Root Cause:** Block validation checked reward *amounts* but not recipient *identity* against the active masternode set for each tier.

**Fix Implemented:** Reward recipient verification added to block validation. If ≥3 violations are recorded against a producer within a 1-hour sliding window, its collateral is slashed and the node is deregistered. The violation counter decays after 1 hour to avoid permanent bans from transient fork confusion.

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs` — `validate_reward_recipients()`; `record_reward_violation()`; 3-violation deregistration threshold
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `slash_collateral()`

---

### 15.6 ✅ FIXED — Sync Loop DoS (AV11)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** Medium — CPU and bandwidth exhaustion; delays fork resolution

**Attack:** A malicious peer sent ≥20 identical `GetBlocks` requests within a 30-second window, repeatedly triggering full chain-scan responses. On a VPS with limited disk I/O this saturated the sled read path and delayed all other network processing.

**Root Cause:** No sync request deduplication or per-peer rate limiting on `GetBlocks` handling.

**Fix Implemented:** `record_sync_flood()` tracks per-peer `GetBlocks` request counts in a 30-second sliding window. After 20 identical requests the peer is rate-limited via `RateLimitPeer`; subsequent floods escalate to `BlockPeer`.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — `record_sync_flood()` call in `GetBlocks` handler
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `SyncLoopFlooding` attack type; `record_sync_flood()`

---

### 15.7 ✅ POLICY CHANGE — Free-Tier Subnet Registration Cap Removed (AV25)
**Status:** **POLICY REVISED**
**Severity:** Medium (original OOM risk retained via task cap; cap removal is safe)

**Original Fix (April 7, 2026):** A per-/24 registration cap (max 5 Free-tier nodes per subnet) and a PHASE3 reconnect cap (max 3 active reconnects per subnet) were introduced in commit `6170dee` to prevent OOM from subnet flooding.

**Policy Reversal:** Both subnet caps were subsequently **removed**. Operators who legitimately own an entire /24 subnet (e.g., a data centre operator running many Free-tier masternodes) were incorrectly blocked. The caps also provided little security benefit against attackers using VPS providers spread across many /24 prefixes.

**Current Approach:** Free-tier nodes from any subnet are accepted in unlimited numbers. Individual misbehavior is detected and penalized per-node by the AI attack detector:
- Rapid cycling → AV3 back-and-forth lockout (600s) + AV26 migration frequency limit (max 3/30 min)
- Invalid vote signature spam → AV27 sliding-window violation (5 failures/30s)
- Unregistered voter spam → AV28 sliding-window violation (10 rejections/60s)
- Sync loop flooding → AV11 `record_sync_flood()` rate-limit

OOM prevention is retained via an overall PHASE3 reconnect concurrency cap (not subnet-gated).

**Code References:**
- `src/network/client.rs` — PHASE3 overall task concurrency cap
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `register()` (subnet cap removed)

---

### 15.8 ✅ FIXED — Multi-Hop Collateral Pool Rotation (AV26)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — evades AV3 back-and-forth cycling detection

**Attack:** AV3 detects A→B→A cycling by checking `collateral_migration_from` (the last source IP). Attackers adapted by using rotation pools: A→B, then B→C, then C→D, then D→A. Each hop looked like a fresh migration because the last source IP was always different. A 4-node pool with a 300s migration cooldown could rotate indefinitely, re-squatting collateral outpoints every 20 minutes.

**Root Cause:** `collateral_migration_from` stored only the immediately previous IP; multi-hop rotations that never revisit the same IP pair in adjacent hops evaded detection entirely.

**Fix Implemented:** A sliding-window migration frequency limit: `collateral_migration_counts` tracks `(count, window_start)` per `txid:vout` outpoint. If an outpoint has been migrated ≥3 times within 1800 seconds (30 minutes), the next migration is rejected regardless of which IP it comes from.

**Code References:**
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `collateral_migration_counts`; `MAX_MIGRATIONS_PER_WINDOW = 3`; `MIGRATION_WINDOW_SECS = 1800`

---

### 15.9 ✅ FIXED — Invalid Vote Signature Spam (AV27)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** Medium — CPU waste from sustained Ed25519 verification failures

**Attack:** Already-connected attacker IPs (observed: `154.217.246.86`) sent `TimeVotePrepare` / `TimeVotePrecommit` messages with forged Ed25519 signatures at ~1–3/second. Each message passed the length check (64 bytes) but failed `public_key.verify()`. The original code returned `Ok(false)` with no violation recorded, allowing the flood to continue indefinitely for the lifetime of the TCP session.

**Root Cause:** `verify_vote_signature()` had no violation recording on the invalid-signature path.

**Fix Implemented:** `invalid_sig_vote_window` sliding-window counter added in `message_handler.rs`. After **5 Ed25519 failures within 30 seconds** from the same peer IP, `record_invalid_vote_sig_spam()` is called on the `AttackDetector`. Structurally malformed votes (empty or wrong-length signatures) record a violation immediately without waiting for the threshold.

**Severity:** Medium
**AI Detection:** `InvalidVoteSignatureSpam` → `RateLimitPeer`

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — `invalid_sig_vote_window` per-peer sliding window; `record_invalid_vote_sig_spam()`
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `InvalidVoteSignatureSpam` attack type; `record_invalid_vote_sig_spam()`

---

### 15.10 ✅ FIXED — Unregistered Voter Spam (AV28)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** Medium — registry lookup overhead from sustained spam of votes for non-existent voters

**Attack:** Attacker nodes relayed `TimeVotePrepare` / `TimeVotePrecommit` messages for voter IDs not present in the masternode registry at ~15/second. Each message triggered an async DashMap read on the registry. The `verify_vote_signature()` unregistered-voter path returned `Ok(false)` with no violation recorded.

**Root Cause:** No rate limiting on the unregistered-voter rejection path. Votes are gossiped on behalf of remote nodes, so a lenient threshold is needed to avoid false positives from transient deregistrations.

**Fix Implemented:** `unregistered_vote_window` sliding-window counter tracks per-peer rejections. After **10 unregistered-voter rejections within 60 seconds**, `record_unregistered_voter_spam()` is called, recording one violation. The 10-rejection threshold accommodates legitimate relay nodes forwarding votes for recently-deregistered masternodes.

**Severity:** Medium
**AI Detection:** `UnregisteredVoterSpam` → `RateLimitPeer`

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — `unregistered_vote_window` per-peer sliding window; `record_unregistered_voter_spam()`
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `UnregisteredVoterSpam` attack type; `record_unregistered_voter_spam()`

---

### 15.11 ✅ CONFIRMED NON-ISSUE — SNI False-Flag / Reputation Poisoning (AV29)
**Status:** **NO FIX NEEDED**
**Severity:** Low (operator confusion only; no protocol impact)

**Scenario:** An attacker sets the TLS SNI field in connection attempts to a victim node's own IP address (e.g., hex-encoded `69.167.168.176`), making log entries appear to attribute TLS violations to a friendly node. An operator observing `getbanlist` output might mistakenly believe a trusted peer is attacking the network.

**Why This Is Not a Real Attack:** Ban attribution in `IPBanlist` is always based on the real TCP source IP obtained from `TcpStream::peer_addr()` at `accept()` time — not from the TLS SNI field. An attacker can forge the SNI value but not the TCP source IP (without IP spoofing, which breaks the TCP handshake). The `getbanlist` CLI command (added in commit `a4d7daa`) allows operators to inspect actual banned IPs and verify that no friendly nodes have been incorrectly penalized.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/server.rs` — `peer_addr()` from `accept()` used for all violation attribution
- `src/bin/time-cli.rs` — `getbanlist` command

---

### 15.11b ✅ FIXED — Transaction Censorship via Selective Relay (AV30)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** Medium — user funds stuck in perpetual "Pending"; wallet shows ghost transactions

**Attack:** A malicious or compromised masternode accepts a `sendrawtransaction` RPC call and immediately returns the txid (success), but deliberately never relays the transaction to other masternodes via TimeVote broadcast. Since the wallet considers the txid return value as confirmation of broadcast, it records the transaction as Pending. The tx never receives TimeVote votes from other masternodes, never finalizes, and is eventually evicted from the malicious node's mempool (e.g., on restart). The wallet is left with a ghost "Pending" send entry that the user cannot clear.

**Attack Variants:**
1. **Malicious relay**: Attacker deliberately accepts but does not relay (censorship).
2. **Node restart / mempool eviction**: Honest node accepts tx, restarts before relaying — tx lost.
3. **Eclipse attack amplification**: If all connected peers are controlled by attacker, all ACK the tx but none relay it — user's funds appear locked indefinitely.

**Root Causes:**
1. **Node side** (`src/rpc/handler.rs`): `send_raw_transaction` spawned `consensus.add_transaction()` as a fire-and-forget `tokio::spawn` task, then immediately returned `Ok(txid)` — even if the consensus task rejected the transaction. Broadcast failures were silently discarded.
2. **Wallet side** (`WalletService.kt`): `refreshTransactionsSync()` never reconciled DB-resident Pending txids against the node's current knowledge. Ghost txids persisted in the DB indefinitely across refreshes.

**Fixes Implemented:**
1. **Node** (`src/rpc/handler.rs`): Replaced `tokio::spawn` fire-and-forget with a direct `await` on `consensus.add_transaction()`. `send_raw_transaction` now returns `RpcError { code: -26 }` if local consensus rejects the transaction — the txid is only returned on `Ok`.
2. **Wallet** (`WalletService.kt`, `WalletDatabase.kt`): `refreshTransactionsSync()` now collects all DB-resident Pending txids, filters out those present in the fresh RPC response, and calls `gettransaction` for the remainder. Any txid that returns `RPC error -5` (not found in blocks or mempool) is deleted from the DB. Network errors (timeouts, connection refused) leave the entry pending for the next refresh cycle.

**Code References:**
- `src/rpc/handler.rs` — `send_raw_transaction()`: await consensus directly; return `-26` on rejection
- `android/.../service/WalletService.kt` — `refreshTransactionsSync()`: ghost-tx purge loop
- `android/.../db/WalletDatabase.kt` — `TransactionDao.getPendingTxids()`, `deleteByTxid()`

### 15.12 ✅ FIXED — Producer Pool Self-Award (AV33)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — reward theft; enables sustained unfair monopolization of block rewards

**Attack:** A modified block producer assigned the Silver, Bronze, or Gold tier pool to itself every block, ignoring the fairness rotation that ensures all masternodes of a given tier receive rewards in turn. Validators accepted these blocks because the total payout amounts per tier were correct — only the *identity* of the winner within each tier was wrong.

**Root Cause:** `validate_pool_distribution()` Step 3 verified that each tier's pool was distributed with the correct total amount per tier but did not verify *which specific node* within the tier received the pool payout.

**Fix Implemented:** Step 3b added to `validate_pool_distribution()`: the fairness-rotation winner for each tier is computed from on-chain `blocks_without_reward` history (same algorithm used by the producer). The validator checks that the actual recipient matches the expected winner. A bitmap drift guard prevents false positives when the active node set changes between production and validation. The `tier_winner` map tracks the actual recipient per tier for audit logging.

**Severity:** High
**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs` — `validate_pool_distribution()` Step 3b; `tier_winner` map; `blocks_without_reward` history lookup

---

### 15.13 ✅ FIXED — Targeted Disconnect / Reward Theft (AV34)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** Medium — temporary reward exclusion for honest nodes; sophisticated attacker can sustain for multiple blocks

**Attack:** An attacker floods a paid-tier masternode with garbage connections or sends spoofed TCP RST packets to force a disconnect. With the node marked inactive, it is excluded from the next block's reward pool. A paid-tier node using the pre-fix PHASE3 reconnect logic could take up to 30 seconds to re-establish (one full block slot at 600 seconds); during that window the attacker's own nodes could absorb the displaced rewards.

**Root Cause:** Paid-tier node disconnect → PHASE3 reconnect → AI cooldown delay (up to 30s). No grace window kept recently-disconnected nodes eligible for rewards. Free-tier nodes were removed from the registry immediately on disconnect.

**Fix Implemented:**
- **90-second reward-eligibility grace window** (`ELIGIBILITY_GRACE_SECS = 90`): `last_seen_at` timestamp preserved on disconnect; nodes disconnected within the grace window remain in all three eligible-pool passes.
- **Priority reconnect on disconnect**: paid-tier node disconnect fires `priority_reconnect_notify` so PHASE3 wakes immediately, bypassing the AI reconnect cooldown for Bronze/Silver/Gold tier.
- **Free-tier registry grace period**: Free-tier nodes kept in registry for 300 seconds after disconnect before stale-cleanup removes them.

**Code References:**
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `ELIGIBILITY_GRACE_SECS = 90`; `last_seen_at`; grace window in eligible-pool passes
- `src/network/client.rs` — `priority_reconnect_notify` channel; Bronze+ cooldown bypass

---

### 15.14 ✅ FIXED — Free-Tier Reward Monopolisation (AV35)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — sustained unfair monopolization of Free-tier (8 TIME) pool

**Attack:** A modified block producer excluded all but one Free-tier address from the 8 TIME pool each block. The pre-fix validator only checked the total Free-tier payout amount, not which specific Free-tier addresses were chosen. The fairness formula had a "dead zone" (`blocks_without_reward / 10`) that allowed a recently-paid node to win every tiebreak for up to 9 consecutive blocks.

**Root Cause:** `validate_pool_distribution()` Step 3b did not apply to the Free tier. The `/10` divisor in the fairness formula created a dead zone where a node with `counter = 0` (just paid) could still score higher than nodes with low counters, allowing repeated self-selection.

**Fix Implemented:**
- `FAIRNESS_V2_HEIGHT = 1730`: gates the switch from the `/10` formula to a direct counter comparison. At this chain height the fairness formula becomes `counter` (no divisor), eliminating the dead zone.
- Step 3b extended to Free tier: a block is rejected if a freshly-paid address (`blocks_without_reward = 0`) receives a Free-tier reward while other Free-tier nodes with higher counters were skipped.

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs` — `FAIRNESS_V2_HEIGHT = 1730`; Step 3b Free-tier extension in `validate_pool_distribution()`

---

### 15.15 ✅ FIXED — Reputation Poisoning / Banlist Manipulation (AV36)
**Status:** **FIXED**
**Severity:** High — targeted banning of honest nodes; can silence legitimate block producers

**Attack:** Three sub-paths were identified:

**Sub-path A — Forged block proposals:** Attacker forges a `BlockProposal` with the victim's IP as the `leader` field and a bad reward distribution. Every validator that processes it calls `record_reward_violation(victim_ip)`. After 3 violations the victim is banned from producing blocks.

**Sub-path B — Relay-forwarded gossip hijack:** Attacker relays a `MasternodeAnnounce` with the victim's IP as `masternode_ip` pointing to an already-locked collateral outpoint. Every node that processes it calls `record_severe_violation(victim_ip)`, triggering a 1-hour ban on the first attempt.

**Sub-path C — Threshold exploitation:** A legitimate peer with clock drift or a key rotation in progress may naturally breach the AV27/AV28 sliding-window thresholds and accumulate violations that should only apply to actual spammers.

**Root Causes:**
- (A) `validate_proposal_rewards()` recorded violations before verifying leader identity via VRF proof.
- (B) `CollateralAlreadyLocked` path always attributed violations to `masternode_ip` regardless of whether the message was relayed.
- (C) Inherent in sliding-window thresholds with no decay.

**Fix Implemented:**
- (A) `validate_block_before_vote()` now authenticates the claimed leader via VRF proof **before** calling `validate_proposal_rewards()`. Unauthenticated proposals record a violation against the *sending peer* (not the claimed leader) and pass `record_violations: false` to prevent poisoning.
- (B) Both `CollateralAlreadyLocked` paths now attribute violations to the *relay peer* (minor violation) rather than the claimed `masternode_ip` when `is_relayed = true`.
- (C) Mitigated by 1-hour decay on reward violations and 30s/60s sliding windows on AV27/AV28 that reset automatically.

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs` — `validate_block_before_vote()`; VRF auth before `validate_proposal_rewards()`; `record_violations` flag
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — `is_relayed` attribution in `CollateralAlreadyLocked` paths

### 15.16 ✅ FIXED — Registration Spam / Slot ID Exhaustion (AV37)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.35, commit `268eaa9`)
**Severity:** High — exhausts slot namespace; corrupts fairness-rotation bitmaps; floods in-memory registry

**Attack:** An attacker submits hundreds of valid `MasternodeRegistration` transactions for the same IP address, each with a different wallet address and txid. Every call to `apply_masternode_registration()` passed the old idempotency guard (which only matched on txid equality), caused `assign_next_slot_id()` to increment the global counter, and overwrote the sled record with the new slot. Net effect: N registrations for the same IP burn N slot_ids, but only one DashMap entry survives (the last one). The orphaned slot_ids corrupt the sorted bitmap used for reward distribution and leader election.

**Observed attack (height 160):**
- `188.26.80.38` registered 49 times — slot_ids 187900–188146 burned
- `50.28.104.50` registered 29 times
- `64.91.241.10` registered 23 times
- All 250+ registrations arrived within one second at the same block height

**Root Cause:** `apply_masternode_registration()` idempotency guard checked `existing.registration_txid == registration_txid`. A different txid for the same IP fell through to `assign_next_slot_id()`, treating it as a brand-new node.

**Fix Implemented — Height-Gated (consensus-safe):**

A height gate is required because all existing nodes have already replayed the spam transactions and have the *last* (highest) slot_id for each attacker IP in their sled state. Changing the assignment rule retroactively would cause fresh nodes replaying from genesis to compute different slot_ids, breaking bitmap consensus.

- **`constants::fork_heights::SLOT_UNIQUENESS_FORK_HEIGHT = 200`** — fork activation height
- **Before height 200:** legacy behaviour preserved — each re-registration with a new txid allocates a fresh slot_id. Chain replay produces identical slot_ids on all nodes regardless of code version.
- **From height 200 onward:** a re-registration with a different txid reuses the IP's existing slot_id. New IPs still receive a fresh slot.
- **Idempotent same-txid path** (Case 2) is unaffected and works at any height.

**Code References:**

- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — `apply_masternode_registration()` slot-uniqueness guard (Cases 1–4)

### 15.17 ✅ FIXED — `tx_finalized` Rate-Limit Saturation Without Peer Escalation (AV40)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.37)
**Severity:** Medium — log flooding, minor CPU overhead, attacker never banned

**Attack:** An attacker (or coordinated group) floods `TransactionFinalized` messages at a rate exceeding the per-peer cap (20/10 s). The rate limiter in `rate_limiter.rs` correctly drops the excess messages, but because the handler body is never reached for rate-limited messages, `record_finality_injection()` is never called. The AttackDetector accumulates no signal, so the escalation tiers (≥5 → `RateLimitPeer`, ≥20 → `BlockPeer`) defined in AV38 are never triggered.

**Observed attack (April 16, 2026 — LW-Michigan, 17:04:12–17:04:31):**
- `43.119.35.195` — 30+ rate-limit hits at 17:04:12, 9 TXs slipped through at 17:04:31, then ~150 more rate-limit hits in the same second. Peer never disconnected.
- `154.64.252.184` — ~40 rate-limit hits at 17:04:33–34. Peer never disconnected.
- `165.84.215.117` — 26 rate-limit hits at 17:04:42. Peer never disconnected.
- `50.28.104.50` — 10 rate-limit hits at 17:04:47–50. Peer never disconnected.
- Four peers flooding simultaneously — coordinated campaign.

**Root cause:** The `"tx_finalized"` rate limiter dropped messages silently without recording a violation. Unlike ping handling (which had a `ping_excess_streak` counter), `tx_finalized` had no equivalent streak escalation.

**Fix:** Added `tx_finalized_excess_streak` counter in `server.rs` `TransactionFinalized` dispatch path. After 5 consecutive rate-limit exceedances, calls `record_finality_injection()` so the existing AV38 two-tier escalation (`RateLimitPeer` / `BlockPeer`) kicks in. On trigger, streak resets and flooder is kicked if violation threshold met.

### 15.18 ✅ FIXED — Ghost Special_data Transaction Mempool Flood (AV41)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.37, extended v1.4.38)
**Severity:** High — mempool resource exhaustion + fork induction via block hash divergence

**Attack (Phase 1 — April 16, 2026):** Attacker crafts TXs with 0 inputs, 0 outputs, and `special_data` set to `Some(MasternodeRegistration { empty fields })`. These passed the AV39 null-TX guard (`special_data.is_none()` = false) and entered the mempool permanently.

**Attack (Phase 2 — April 19, 2026):** After format validation was added, attackers evolved to craft TXs with **valid-format but cryptographically forged** signatures — correct pubkey length, valid IP:port format, non-empty fields, but a signature that does not verify. These passed `validate_fields()` and re-entered the mempool. With 35 ghost TXs in the finalized pool, they were being included in blocks, causing different nodes to produce blocks with different hashes (fork induction without mining a competing chain).

**Observed attack (April 19, 2026):**
- 35 finalized ghost TXs in pool, all 0.00 TIME, 0 fee, ~270 bytes (valid-format fake special_data)
- Ghost TXs surviving the periodic sweep (which only checked `validate_fields()`, not signatures)
- Ghost TXs included in block 589, visible in explorer as `(coinbase)` / `(no outputs)` entries

**Root cause of Phase 2:** `purge_ghost_transactions()` and the `TransactionFinalized` guard both called only `validate_fields()` (format check) — not `verify_signature()` (crypto check). The block assembly loop's UTXO input check also silently skipped 0-input TXs since the validation loop body never executed.

**All Fixes Applied:**
- **`SpecialTransactionData::validate_fields()`** (`types.rs`): format check — non-empty strings, 64-hex pubkey, IP:port format.
- **`SpecialTransactionData::verify_signature()`** (`types.rs`, new in v1.4.38): full Ed25519 signature verification using the embedded pubkey and canonical message format (mirrors `masternode_registry.rs`). Covers `MasternodeRegistration`, `MasternodeDeregistration`, `MasternodePayoutUpdate`.
- **`TransactionFinalized` handler** (`server.rs`): 0-input/0-output TXs must pass both `validate_fields()` AND `verify_signature()` before pool admission.
- **`purge_ghost_transactions()`** (`transaction_pool.rs`): extended to also call `verify_signature()` — catches forged-signature TXs already in the pool. Sweep interval reduced from 5 minutes to 60 seconds.
- **Block assembly guard** (`blockchain.rs`): 0-input/0-output TXs evicted from the finalized pool before block inclusion unless `validate_fields()` + `verify_signature()` both pass. Prevents ghost TXs from ever reaching a block regardless of how they entered the pool.
- **Startup purge** (`main.rs`): runs extended purge on mempool restore, clearing any TXs that persisted from before the fix.

**Why ghost TXs cause forks:** Different nodes accumulate different ghost TX sets. When a block producer includes ghost TXs from its finalized pool, nodes missing those TXs produce a different block hash at the same height, triggering fork resolution storms without the attacker needing to mine anything.

### 15.19 ✅ FIXED — Finality Lock Whitelist Bypass via Post-Block-Delivery Disconnect (AV42)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.38)
**Severity:** High — permanently strands nodes on minority forks despite valid whitelisted peer delivering correct chain

**Attack:** When a whitelisted peer delivers a longer valid chain during fork resolution, it may disconnect immediately after (e.g., due to a separate oversized-frame attack — see AV43). The finality lock's peer count scan runs after disconnection, finds `supporting=0` and `total_ahead=0`, and fails all escape conditions. The node remains locked on its minority fork indefinitely. All subsequent sync attempts from the same whitelisted peer repeat this race.

**Observed attack (April 19, 2026):**
```
✅ Fork: ACCEPT 50.28.107.33 — longer chain (586 > ours 583)
✅ Chain validation passed: 10 blocks form valid continuous chain
🚫 Finality lock prevents reorg to ancestor 576 (confirmed 583).
   Not enough ahead peers (1 required) support the alternative chain.
```
Peer `50.28.107.33` (whitelisted) disconnected due to an 842 MB frame (AV43) before the peer count scan ran.

**Root cause:** All finality lock escape conditions (`normal_override`, `longer_chain_escape`, `escape_override`) require `total_ahead > 0` or `supporting >= 1`, which evaluate to zero when the delivering peer has already disconnected from the registry.

**Fix Applied:** New `whitelisted_peer_escape` condition in `blockchain.rs`: if `peer_tip_height > our_height` AND the delivering peer is whitelisted AND the finality lock has been blocked for ≥10 seconds, bypass the peer count requirement entirely. A whitelisted peer is operator-trusted — if it delivered a longer valid chain, that is sufficient evidence the local node is on a minority fork.

### 15.20 ✅ FIXED — Post-Handshake Oversized Frame DoS (AV43)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.38)
**Severity:** Medium — forcibly disconnects sync peers; combined with AV42 prevents fork recovery

**Attack:** After completing the protocol handshake (so the IP is not penalised as a pre-handshake DoS), the attacker sends a TCP frame with a declared length of 800–930 MB. This causes an immediate `Frame too large` disconnect. The attacker targets nodes that are serving block sync to recovering nodes, breaking the sync pipe at the critical moment when blocks are in transit.

**Observed attack (April 19, 2026):**
- Peers 47.82.240.104, 47.79.38.55, 47.79.35.65 sending 842–926 MB frames post-handshake
- Pre-existing guard only penalised pre-handshake oversized frames

**Root cause:** `server.rs` Frame-too-large handler checked `!handshake_done` before recording a violation. Post-handshake large frames were treated as potential framing-mismatch with old nodes and not penalised.

**Fix Applied:** Frames > 100 MB post-handshake are now treated as clearly malicious (no legitimate TIME message approaches this size) and trigger a violation record. Smaller post-handshake overflows (framing-mismatch with old nodes) are still not penalised.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/server.rs` — Frame-too-large handler (`MALICIOUS_FRAME_BYTES = 100 MB` threshold)

### 15.21 ✅ FIXED — Whitelisted Peer Self-Isolation via False Reward-Hijack Ban (AV44)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.38)
**Severity:** Critical — node permanently bans all its own whitelisted peers, achieving complete network isolation without the attacker touching those peers at all

**Attack:** A node running slightly outdated code has a stale masternode registry (e.g., 226 entries vs the network's 232). When it receives block 598 from any peer, its reward calculator produces a different result than the block (it doesn't know about 6 masternodes). The reward-hijacking detector fires, permanently bans the peer, and marks it incompatible. Because every peer serves the same correct block 598, the node permanently bans **all** its peers including whitelisted ones within ~5 seconds of startup, achieving complete isolation.

**Observed attack (April 19, 2026):**
- Arizona node (commit 1995, registry size 226) received block 598 (bitmap capacity 232)
- Banned all 8+ peers including whitelisted 69.167.168.176, 165.84.215.117, 158.247.220.125, 188.166.243.108, 139.180.206.91 within 5 seconds
- Node had no remaining compatible peers, could not sync or produce blocks

**Root cause:** The reward-hijacking permanent ban had no exception for whitelisted peers. A reward discrepancy with a whitelisted peer almost certainly indicates the local node has a stale registry — not that the whitelisted peer is malicious.

**Fix Applied:** Before issuing a permanent ban for reward manipulation, check if the peer is whitelisted. If so, disconnect without banning and log a warning to update the local node. Applies to both the `BlockAnnounce` handler and the `spawn_fork_resolution` reorg path.

**Code References:**

### 15.22 ✅ FIXED — Coordinated Multi-Vector Network Destabilisation (AV45)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.38, mitigated across multiple fixes)
**Severity:** Critical — combination of individually-medium vectors achieves chain halt and node isolation

**Attack:** Observed April 19, 2026. The 154.217.246.x/24 subnet and 47.79.x.x/47.82.x.x subnets executed a coordinated attack using four simultaneous vectors:

1. **Ghost TX flood (AV41 Phase 2)**: Forged-signature special_data TXs injected into finalized pools → different nodes include different ghost TXs in blocks → artificial fork creation without mining
2. **Post-handshake oversized frames (AV43)**: 800–930 MB frames disconnect whitelisted sync peers mid-delivery → combined with finality lock race (AV42) to strand nodes on minority forks
3. **tx_finalized spam**: 64.118.152.210 and 154.64.252.184 flooding hundreds of `TransactionFinalized` messages/second → CPU load, log noise masking real attack activity
4. **Reward-manipulation blocks**: 154.217.246.x nodes serving blocks with redistributed rewards → triggers reward-hijack bans against legitimate peers on nodes with stale registries (AV44)

**Effect:** Nodes that banned their whitelisted peers (AV44) were then stuck on minority forks (AV42) with no clean sync path. Ghost TXs in blocks caused those forks to have different hashes even when legitimate TXs were identical. The combination prevented convergence for ~30+ minutes.

**Mitigations:** Each component vector is individually fixed (AV41, AV42, AV43, AV44). Additionally, whitelist-exclusive sync (nodes >10 blocks behind only download from whitelisted peers) prevents attacker-controlled peers from providing the canonical chain during recovery.

---

### 15.23 ✅ FIXED — Whitelisted-Peer-Exclusive Sync Bypass (AV46)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.38)
**Severity:** Medium — nodes >10 blocks behind could sync from attacker peers instead of trusted whitelisted peers

**Attack:** When a node is significantly behind (>10 blocks), it previously selected sync peers from all connected peers ranked by chain tip height. An attacker with many connected peers (from the regular peer pool) could outrank the 1–2 whitelisted peers and serve a fork chain, causing the recovering node to adopt the attacker's chain.

**Fix Applied:** When a node is >10 blocks behind AND at least one whitelisted peer is connected, block downloads are restricted exclusively to whitelisted peers. The attacker's peers are excluded regardless of their reported chain tip height.

**Code References:**
- `src/blockchain.rs` — `sync_from_peers()` whitelist-exclusive gate (~line 2289)

---

### 15.24 ✅ FIXED — Ghost TX Mempool Sync Injection (AV47)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.37)
**Severity:** High — ghost transactions entered the finalized pool with zero validation, bypassing all AV41 guards

**Attack:** The `MempoolSyncResponse` handler (`handle_mempool_sync_response` in `message_handler.rs`) added finalized transactions directly via `consensus.add_finalized_direct()` with no validation. When an honest node connects to an attacker peer, the peer includes ghost TXs in its `MempoolSyncResponse` marked as `is_finalized=true`. These bypass the `TransactionFinalized` message guard entirely and enter the finalized pool directly.

**Observed:** 35 ghost TXs accumulated in the finalized pool with ages up to 2m 15s — after AV41 Phase 2 fixes were deployed. All had 0 inputs, 0 outputs, and 0 fees. The AV41 guard in `server.rs` was correct but only applied to `TransactionFinalized` messages, not to mempool sync.

**Root cause:** Two code paths can add TXs to the finalized pool: (1) `TransactionFinalized` messages (guarded), and (2) `MempoolSyncResponse` (unguarded).

**Fix Applied:** Added the same AV41/AV48 validation guard to `handle_mempool_sync_response` before calling `add_finalized_direct`. Ghost TXs in incoming mempool syncs are now silently dropped.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message_handler.rs` — `handle_mempool_sync_response()`, guard before `add_finalized_direct`

---

### 15.25 ✅ FIXED — Ghost TX Fresh-Keypair Bypass (AV48)

**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.37)
**Severity:** High — attacker could generate valid-signature ghost TXs that bypassed AV41's cryptographic check

**Attack (Phase 3):** AV41 Phase 2 added `verify_signature()` to reject ghost TXs with forged signatures. The attacker adapted: they generate a fresh Ed25519 keypair, derive a valid `wallet_address` from it (using the standard TIME address derivation), and sign the `MasternodeRegistration` special_data with their fresh private key. The `verify_signature()` check PASSES because the signature is cryptographically valid — the key and address are internally consistent. The collateral UTXO they reference does not exist, but that check happens later in block assembly, not in the mempool admission gate.

**Root cause:** `verify_signature()` only verifies that the signature was produced by the private key for the embedded `pubkey`. It does not verify that `wallet_address` was actually derived from `pubkey`. An attacker can pair any arbitrary `wallet_address` string with a fresh keypair and valid signature.

**Fix Applied:** Added `verify_address_binding()` to `SpecialTransactionData` which derives the expected address from `pubkey` using `Address::from_public_key()` (SHA-256 → RIPEMD-160 → base58check with TIME prefix) and compares it to `wallet_address`. If they don't match, the TX is rejected.

Applied at all four enforcement points:
1. `TransactionFinalized` message handler (`src/network/server.rs`)
2. `MempoolSyncResponse` handler (`src/network/message_handler.rs`)
3. Ghost TX purge sweep (`src/transaction_pool.rs`, both pending and confirmed)
4. Block assembly ghost TX gate (`src/blockchain.rs`)

### 15.27 ✅ FIXED — Inbound Connection Flood (AV50)
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.5.x** (April 20, 2026)
**Severity:** High — connection slot exhaustion, CPU waste on TCP accept loop

**Attack:** A coordinated botnet generates 50–76+ inbound TCP connections per minute from IPs across the same /24 subnet (observed: `47.82.254.82`, `47.82.240.104`, `47.82.227.36`, `47.79.35.65` on April 20, 2026). The `can_accept_inbound()` rate limiter correctly rejected each connection, but the AI layer had **zero visibility** — no detection record, no violation, no subnet ban escalation. The attacker could sustain this indefinitely at no cost.

**Observed (live log, April 20, 2026):**
```
🚫 Rejected inbound connection from 47.82.254.82: Connection rate limit exceeded: 55 connections in last minute
🚫 Rejected inbound connection from 47.82.240.104: Connection rate limit exceeded: 73 connections in last minute
🚫 Rejected inbound connection from 47.82.227.36: Connection rate limit exceeded: 76 connections in last minute
```

**Root Cause:** `can_accept_inbound()` rejection path logged a warning and dropped the connection, but did not call any AI recording method. The existing subnet rate-limiter (`subnet_accept_rate` / `MAX_SUBNET_CONNECTS_PER_MIN`) also misattributed rejections to `record_tls_failure()` rather than a connection-flood-specific detector.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **`record_connection_flood()` method** added to `AttackDetector` with per-/24 + per-IP sliding windows:
  - single noisy IP: ≥4 rate-limited rejections/60s → `RateLimitPeer`, ≥8/60s → `BlockPeer`
  - coordinated subnet flood: ≥10 rate-limited rejections/60s from ≥3 unique IPs in the same /24 → `BanSubnet(/24)`
- ✅ This prevents one or two stale/misconfigured nodes from poisoning an entire subnet while still escalating genuine distributed floods
- ✅ **Wired at `can_accept_inbound` rejection** in `server.rs` accept loop
- ✅ **Wired at subnet accept rate** rejection (replacing the misattributed `record_tls_failure` call)

**Code References:**
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `ConnectionFlood` attack type; `record_connection_flood()`; `connection_flood_times` sliding window
- `src/network/server.rs` — `record_connection_flood()` at `can_accept_inbound` Err path and `subnet_accept_rate` reject path

### 15.28 ✅ FIXED — Frame Bomb Attack (AV51)
**Status:** **FIXED in v1.5.x** (April 20, 2026)
**Severity:** Critical — 4 bytes of TCP data trigger a multi-GB OOM attempt

**Attack:** A peer sends a TCP frame with a 4-byte length header claiming a body of `4,083,387,062 bytes` (~3.8 GB), observed twice from `64.91.224.76` within the same 10-second window (April 20, 2026). Only 4 bytes need to be transmitted — the node reads the length prefix, attempts to allocate the buffer, and is killed by the OS OOM killer or panics. The existing 8 MB frame size cap in `wire.rs` correctly disconnects the peer, and the banlist recorded a violation — but the AI had no record, so it could not correlate repeated attempts or escalate to a permanent ban.

**Observed (live log, April 20, 2026):**
```
Connection from 64.91.224.76:36020 ended: Frame too large: 4083387062 bytes (max: 8388608)
Connection from 64.91.224.76:36048 ended: Frame too large: 4083387062 bytes (max: 8388608)
```

**Root Cause:** The `is_large_frame && clearly_malicious` branch in `server.rs` called `banlist.record_violation()` but did not call any AI method. A single peer sending the same frame bomb twice (identical 4083387062-byte header) had no AI visibility, so the detector could not escalate to `BlockPeer`.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **`record_frame_bomb()` method** added to `AttackDetector` with per-IP sliding window: 1st frame → `RateLimitPeer` (gentle, in case IP is shared); 2nd frame within 120s → `BlockPeer` (clearly deliberate repeat)
- ✅ **Wired after `banlist.record_violation()`** in the `is_large_frame && clearly_malicious` branch in `server.rs`

**Code References:**

### 15.29 ✅ FIXED — Spent UTXO Re-Add via Peer Finalization Path (AV52)

**Status:** **FIXED in v1.5.0** (April 26, 2026)
**Severity:** High — balance doubles on node restart; spent inputs reappear as spendable

**Attack / Bug:** When a peer node received a `TransactionFinalized` message, the handler called `update_state(input, SpentFinalized)` — updating only the in-memory `utxo_states` DashMap. Input UTXOs remained in sled storage and in the `address_index`. After any node restart, `initialize_states()` reloads from sled and resurrects those inputs as `Unspent`. Both the original input UTXOs and the new output UTXOs then appear simultaneously as spendable, doubling the balance returned by `getbalance` and `listunspentmulti` for any wallet querying that node. This also created a latent window where a malicious actor could attempt to re-spend an already-finalized input across a restart.

**Root Cause (primary):** `server.rs` `TransactionFinalized` handler used `update_state` (in-memory only) instead of `mark_timevote_finalized` (removes from sled + `address_index`).

**Root Cause (secondary):** No hard invariant prevented `add_utxo` from accepting an outpoint that had previously been spent, if both `utxo_states` and sled had been cleared or not yet populated on that peer.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **`mark_timevote_finalized` in peer handler** — `server.rs` `TransactionFinalized` handler now calls `mark_timevote_finalized` for each input, removing them from sled storage and the `address_index` (not just the in-memory state map). Matches the behaviour of the originating node's auto-finalization path.
- ✅ **Permanent spent tombstone** — `UTXOStateManager` gains `spent_tombstones: DashSet<OutPoint>` and a sled-backed `spent_db: Option<sled::Tree>`. Every call to `mark_timevote_finalized` or `spend_utxo` records the outpoint in both. `add_utxo` checks the tombstone first and returns `AlreadySpent` unconditionally. The tombstone set is loaded from disk on startup (before `initialize_states`) and cleared only by `clear_all()` at the start of a reindex. `restore_utxo()` (fork rollback) lifts the tombstone for the specific outpoint being un-spent.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/server.rs` — `TransactionFinalized` handler: `mark_timevote_finalized` replaces `update_state`
- `src/utxo_manager.rs` — `spent_tombstones`/`spent_db` fields; `record_spent()`; `enable_spent_persistence()`; `add_utxo` tombstone check; `restore_utxo` tombstone lift; `clear_all` tombstone wipe
- `src/main.rs` — `enable_spent_persistence()` called after `enable_collateral_persistence`, before `initialize_states`

---

### 15.30 ✅ FIXED — Wallet-GUI Consolidation Race Condition (AV53)

**Status:** **FIXED in v1.5.0** (April 26, 2026)
**Severity:** Medium — displayed balance inflated 2× during and after UTXO consolidation

**Attack / Bug:** The wallet-GUI consolidation background task submits batches of consolidation transactions via `broadcast_transaction` RPC. The node emits a `tx_notification` WebSocket event immediately upon receiving the raw transaction (before `add_transaction` even runs) and an `utxo_finalized` WS event immediately upon finalization. Both WS events arrive at the wallet before `broadcast_transaction` RPC returns the txid. At that point, the txid is not yet in `consolidation_txids`, so the `is_consolidation` guard evaluates to `false`. Since there is also no `send_record` for the txid, and the output address is the wallet's own address (`is_own_addr = true`), both the `TransactionReceived` and `UtxoFinalized` handlers create a **phantom receive entry** with `is_change = false`. These phantom entries are counted in `computed_balance`, doubling the displayed total (original UTXOs still visible + phantom receive of the same amount). Both the desktop wallet and any mobile wallet reading from the same node exhibited the symptom.

**Root Cause:** `broadcast_transaction` inserts the txid into `consolidation_txids` only after the RPC call returns, but WS events propagate synchronously through the node's finalization path before that return.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Pre-registration in WS handlers** — both `WsEvent::TransactionReceived` and `WsEvent::UtxoFinalized` handlers in `service.rs` now check `consolidation_active.load() && is_own_addr` before evaluating `is_consolidation`. If both are true, the txid is inserted into `consolidation_txids` immediately and `is_consolidation` is set to `true`, preventing the phantom receive from being recorded regardless of when the RPC returns.

**Code References:**
- `wallet-gui/src/service.rs` (time-wallet repo) — `WsEvent::TransactionReceived` and `WsEvent::UtxoFinalized` handlers: early `consolidation_txids` insertion when `consolidation_active && is_own_addr`

### 15.26 ✅ FIXED — Deregistration Spam Flood (AV49)

**Observed:** Block 710 on LW-Arizona (April 19, 2026) contained **50+ `MasternodeDeregistration` transactions all targeting the same slot** (`64.91.248.55`, slot `659724`). Each had a unique txid but identical target. The block was accepted and all 50 deregistrations were applied redundantly, wasting processing time and registry state operations.

**Root Cause:** No deduplication existed at any layer — mempool, block assembly, or block processing — to prevent multiple deregistration transactions for the same slot entering the same block.

**Impact:**
- Block space exhaustion: 50+ wasted transactions crowd out legitimate TXs
- Registry thrashing: each deregistration triggers sled writes and gossip
- Can be used to grief specific masternodes by cycling deregister/re-register rapidly
- Contributes to registry divergence across nodes (different nodes apply different subsets)

**Fix Applied (three layers):**
1. **Mempool** (`transaction_pool.rs`): `add_pending_with_submitter()` rejects a deregistration TX if the pending pool already contains one for the same `slot_id`. Returns `PoolError::AlreadyExists`.
2. **Block assembly** (`blockchain.rs`): Before the size-cap pass, `retain()` removes all but the first deregistration per `slot_id` from the finalized TX list.
3. **Block processing** (`blockchain.rs`): `process_special_transactions()` tracks `seen_dereg_slots: HashSet<u32>`; duplicate slot entries are logged as AV49 and skipped.

**Also fixed (related observation):** `64.118.156.97` induced a bad reorg on Arizona at height 710 using the hash tiebreaker, placing Arizona on a minority fork. Arizona was recovered via `rollbacktoheight 709`.

**Observed (April 8 watchdog log):**
```
16:20:24 🔁 De-registration detected after 2 consecutive checks — restarting timed (restart #12)
16:35:39 🔁 De-registration detected after 2 consecutive checks — restarting timed (restart #13)
16:46:00 🔁 De-registration detected after 2 consecutive checks — restarting timed (restart #14)
... (5 more restarts at ~10 min intervals)
```

**Root Cause (two parts):**
1. **Shared rate-limiter mutex** — `Arc<RwLock<RateLimiter>>` is shared across ALL inbound peer connections; write-lock contention under load directly starves the RPC server task
2. **Watchdog does not distinguish RPC busy from RPC dead** — any 3-second RPC timeout is treated as de-registration

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **`fork_resolution_blocked_until` cooldown** (commit `92737ad`) — stops the deep-fetch busy-loop from restarting every 15s on finality lock; removes the biggest single contributor to tokio saturation
- ✅ **`MIN_PEERS_FINALITY_OVERRIDE` lowered 5 → 2** (commit `92737ad`) — node escapes minority fork within 60s instead of being permanently stuck
- ✅ **Watchdog activity-check before restart** (commit `f3e6229`) — checks `journalctl` for recent log activity before treating RPC timeout as de-registration (see section 14.12)
- ✅ **Per-connection rate limiter** (commit `22e056a`) — `handle_peer()` now creates a local `RateLimiter::new()` that shadows the shared parameter; each peer's rate checks are fully independent with zero cross-peer lock contention
- ✅ **Pre-channel message gate** (commit `22e056a`) — TLS and plaintext I/O bridge tasks count raw messages per second before forwarding to the processing channel; soft limit 200/s (silent drop), hard limit 500/s (error → disconnect). **Authenticated-peer carve-out** (commit `21d1602`): post-handshake peers are disconnected on burst but NOT fed `record_message_flood()` — avoiding false IP bans on legitimate sync/gossip bursts. Only unauthenticated (pre-handshake) burst traffic triggers the AI enforcement path.
- ✅ **Ping flood escalation** (commit `22e056a`) — `ping_excess_streak` counter escalates 3 consecutive rate-limit exceedances to `record_violation()` + `record_ping_flood()`; peer is disconnected on ban threshold. **MissedTickBehavior::Skip** (commit `9a96f82`): ping interval timers now skip missed ticks instead of bursting, preventing scheduler backlog from generating false PingFlood violations.
- ✅ **`PingFlood` / `MessageFlood` in `AttackDetector`** (commit `22e056a`) — new `AttackType` variants with sliding-window detection methods; feed the 30s enforcement loop → `IPBanlist` auto-ban

### 15.29 ✅ FIXED (fork@10000) — Collateral Hijacking / Registration Tug-of-War (AV52)

**Observed:** April 2026 — multiple IPs (e.g. `64.91.241.10`, `50.28.104.50`, `188.166.243.108`) registering dozens of times in the same block, slot numbers in the 4000s by block height 41. Operators reported continuous re-registration cycles ("tug-of-war") where their masternodes were repeatedly displaced and had to re-register.

**Root Cause (two parts):**

1. **Missing collateral ownership check (primary):** `apply_masternode_registration` looked up the collateral UTXO to determine the tier but never verified that the UTXO's `address` matches the `wallet_address` in the registration TX. Any node could craft a registration TX claiming any UTXO they don't own:
   - Set `collateral_outpoint` = victim's UTXO (visible on-chain)
   - Set `wallet_address` = attacker's address
   - Set `pubkey` = attacker's key
   - Sign the message with attacker's key (valid signature — just not the UTXO owner's key)
   - Block processes: UTXO exists → tier assigned → registration accepted
   - Attacker now receives tier-weighted (Bronze/Silver/Gold) block rewards at their own address
   - Victim's node detects displacement, re-registers, attacker re-registers → infinite tug-of-war

2. **IBD registration churn (secondary):** Free-tier nodes checked `is_masternode_registered()` before auto-submitting a startup registration TX. This check queries the sled DB, which is not populated during Initial Block Download. A node restarted during IBD would submit a new registration TX even though its registration was already on-chain in the blocks being synced — adding another slot (before height 200) or causing churn (at/after height 200).

**Impact:**
- Paid-tier rewards stolen at above-Free-tier rates (Bronze=10×, Silver=100×, Gold=1000× weight)
- Legitimate masternodes repeatedly displaced from their slot
- Continuous registration churn inflates block sizes and wastes slot IDs
- Visible as slot numbers growing rapidly (4000+ by block 41) and log floods of duplicate registrations

**Fix Applied:**

1. **Collateral ownership check** (`masternode_registry.rs`, `apply_masternode_registration`): At heights >= `COLLATERAL_OWNERSHIP_FORK_HEIGHT` (10,000), registration transactions for paid-tier nodes are rejected if `utxo.address != wallet_address`. This makes collateral hijacking financially worthless — the attacker cannot redirect rewards away from the UTXO owner.

2. **Per-block duplicate-IP guard** (`blockchain.rs`, `process_special_transactions`): At/above the fork height, a `seen_reg_ips: HashSet<String>` deduplicates registration transactions within a single block. Only the first registration per IP per block is applied; duplicates are logged as AV-COLHIJACK and skipped. Mirrors the existing `seen_dereg_slots` guard for deregistrations (AV49).

3. **IBD registration guard** (`main.rs`): Added `!blockchain.is_syncing()` guard to the Free-tier auto-registration startup check. Nodes in IBD no longer submit registration TXs they don't need — their on-chain registration will be applied naturally as blocks are synced.

**Code References:**
- `src/constants.rs` — `COLLATERAL_OWNERSHIP_FORK_HEIGHT = 1_200`
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — AV-COLHIJACK ownership check after UTXO lookup
- `src/blockchain.rs` — `seen_reg_ips` per-block dedup guard
- `src/main.rs` — `is_syncing()` guard on Free-tier auto-registration

**OPERATOR ACTION REQUIRED:** `COLLATERAL_OWNERSHIP_FORK_HEIGHT` is set to block 1,200. All nodes must upgrade before the chain reaches this height or they will diverge from nodes running the new code, causing a chain split.

### 15.31 ✅ SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS — May 2026 Bug Fixes and MasternodeUnlock Feature

Three bugs fixed and one new security feature introduced in commits `d9a4369`,
`31ac714`, and `8e13246`.

#### Fix 1 — Outbound Masternode Announcement Gap (commit d9a4369)

**Root Cause:** `peer_connection.rs` only sent `MasternodeAnnouncementV4` on
inbound connections (initiated by the remote peer). Connections the local node
dialled out **never** sent an announcement. The remote peer therefore had no
record of the connecting node as a masternode — causing registry gaps, missed
liveness signals, and reward-eligibility mismatches for outbound peers.

**Security Impact:** A node whose only connections are outbound would be invisible
as a masternode to all its peers, preventing it from participating in TimeVote
consensus and receiving rewards. An attacker with many nodes could exploit this to
cause well-connected operators to miss reward windows without taking any
connection down.

**Fix:** Outbound connections now send `MasternodeAnnouncementV4` (falling back to
V3 for older peers) immediately after the handshake completes, mirroring
`server.rs`.

#### Fix 2 — Collateral-Churn Guard Blocking Legitimate Tier Upgrades (commit 31ac714)

**Root Cause:** The Collateral-Churn guard (Case A) in `masternode_registry.rs`
blocked ALL outpoint replacements when the old UTXO still existed on-chain. This
correctly prevented an attacker from claiming a live collateral UTXO, but also
prevented the legitimate operator from upgrading their tier (e.g., Silver → Gold)
with a larger collateral UTXO they owned.

**Security Impact (of the bug):** Operators wishing to upgrade their tier had no
path other than a full deregistration cycle. If the old UTXO was still unspent
during the new registration, the upgrade would be blocked and the operator would
be temporarily unregistered, losing rewards.

**Fix:** The guard now checks `prefetched_utxo_addr == masternode.wallet_address`.
If the new UTXO is owned by the same operator, the replacement is allowed and
logged as `[Collateral-Upgrade] Allowed...`. Unauthenticated replacements by
third parties are still blocked with `[Collateral-Churn] Blocked...`.

#### Fix 3 — Startup Log Showed IP Instead of Wallet Address (commit d9a4369)

**Root Cause:** `src/main.rs` lines ~1049 and ~1076 logged `mn.address` (the
node's IP address) where `mn.wallet_address` (the TIME reward address) should
appear. Operators reading the startup log could not verify that rewards would be
routed to the correct wallet, potentially missing misconfiguration silently.

**Fix:** Both log lines now display `mn.wallet_address`.

#### New Feature — Signed MasternodeUnlock / Gossip-Based Collateral Release (commit 8e13246)

**Security motivation:** Previously, if an operator shut down their masternode
without spending the collateral UTXO, peers would hold the collateral lock
indefinitely until the 1-hour registry auto-expiry or the 3-block UTXO-miss
cleanup. An adversary could exploit this by repeatedly re-registering on behalf
of the outpoint (via AV52-style hijacking), keeping the lock alive. There was no
authenticated revoke mechanism the operator could trigger remotely.

**Feature:** `MasternodeUnlock { address, collateral_outpoint, timestamp,
signature }` is now broadcast via gossip on startup when a collateral outpoint is
removed from `masternode.conf`. The Ed25519 signature over
`"TIME_COLLATERAL_REVOKE:<address>:<txid>:<vout>:<timestamp>"` proves ownership
without requiring on-chain spend.

**Security properties:**
- Signed revokes are relayed and applied on all peers within ~15 seconds.
- Replay protection: `timestamp` must be within ±300 s of the receiver's clock.
- Unsigned revokes (backward compat) are accepted only over a direct TCP
  connection from the masternode's registered IP — never relayed, preventing
  spoofing from third parties.
- Eliminates the class of indefinite-collateral-lock attacks where an operator
  cannot free their UTXO without spending it.

**Code References:**
- `src/network/message.rs` — `MasternodeUnlock` struct definition
- `src/network/peer_connection.rs` — outbound announcement fix
- `src/masternode_registry.rs` — Collateral-Churn Case A tier-upgrade allow
- `src/main.rs` — MasternodeUnlock broadcast timer; wallet address log fix

---

### 14.12 ✅ FIXED — Watchdog False-Restart on RPC Timeout
**Status:** **FIXED in watchdog v1.1** (April 8, 2026)

**Attack / Failure Mode:** The masternode watchdog script (`mn-watchdog.sh`) treated any `masternodestatus` RPC timeout as "de-registration detected" and restarted `timed` after 2 consecutive failures (a ~6-second window at the 3-second RPC timeout default). A node legitimately busy processing fork resolution or a reconnection storm is alive and healthy, but its tokio RPC handler thread is temporarily starved — the daemon is not dead or de-registered.

**Consequence:** Nodes restarted every ~10 minutes even though they had caught up to the canonical chain and were operating normally. Each restart reset the masternode registration startup sequence, causing a ~60s window of ineligibility for block production rewards on every cycle.

**Attack amplification:** An attacker who can trigger a brief reconnection storm (by coordinating 40+ Free-tier nodes to disconnect/reconnect simultaneously — AV3/AV25) can induce continuous watchdog restarts without ever directly attacking consensus.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **`daemon_recently_active()` function** — checks `journalctl -u timed` for log entries within the last `DAEMON_ACTIVE_SECS` seconds (default: 90s). If the daemon has logged recently, it is alive and busy — not dead or de-registered.
- ✅ **Separate busy-streak counter** — RPC timeouts while the daemon is logging increment `rpc_busy_streak`; restart is suppressed until `rpc_busy_streak >= RPC_BUSY_MAX` (default: 10, i.e. ~90s of continuous unresponsiveness with recent log activity). Silent failures still escalate normally via `fail_streak`.
- ✅ **Raised default `RPC_TIMEOUT`** from 3s → 8s — gives the tokio RPC handler more time to respond during load spikes
- ✅ **Raised default `FAIL_THRESHOLD`** from 2 → 3 — three consecutive confirmed failures before restart
- ✅ **Accurate log message** — distinguishes "node busy (RPC timeout but daemon logging)" from "de-registration detected (RPC returned not-active status)"

**Code References:**
- `scripts/mn-watchdog.sh` — `daemon_recently_active()`, `rpc_busy_streak`, `RPC_BUSY_MAX`, `DAEMON_ACTIVE_SECS`

## PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
1. **COMPLETED ✅:** Pre-vote block validation (Fixed Jan 19, 2026)
2. **COMPLETED ✅:** Block reward validation (Fixed Jan 19, 2026)
3. **COMPLETED ✅:** VRF for leader selection (Implemented Jan 2026)

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. **COMPLETED ✅:** TLS Integration (enabled by default, commit `c69f159`)
   - TLS active on all P2P connections via `enable_tls = true` (config default)
   - Eliminates BGP hijacking and MITM attack vectors

5. **Implement Stake Slashing**
   - Penalize provable misbehavior (double signing, invalid blocks)
   - Deterrent against bribery/collusion
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 weeks
   - **Priority increased:** Should be next major security feature

6. **Regular Dependency Audits**
   - Run `cargo audit` before each release
   - Monitor RustSec advisories
   - Consider `cargo-deny` for automated policy enforcement
   - **Status:** Should be added to CI/CD pipeline

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS)
6. **Cross-Chain Replay Protection — ✅ Implemented in v1.5.0, activates at block 1000**
   - **Background:** Base transactions did not include `chain_id` in their signed bytes, meaning a transaction signed on one chain was cryptographically valid on any fork sharing the same genesis.
   - **Threat model:** Does NOT allow creating coins from nothing. An attacker could spend pre-fork UTXOs on both chains simultaneously. Post-fork UTXOs are already rejected by the mainnet UTXO set (`"UTXO not found"`).
   - **Fix implemented:** Transaction `version >= 2` uses a new signing message format: `CHAIN_ID(4 bytes LE) || txid || input_index || outputs_hash`. `CHAIN_ID = 1` for mainnet. Any future intentional fork must be assigned a distinct chain_id before diverging.
   - **Activation mechanism:** All value-transfer transactions (non-empty inputs) in blocks at height ≥ 1000 must have `version >= 2`. v1 transactions are evicted at block assembly. Special/coinbase transactions (no inputs) are exempt.
   - **Upgrade path:** All operators must upgrade to v1.5.0 before block 1000 (~2.8 days from April 19, 2026). Upgrade notifications sent to all newsletter subscribers. Nodes that do not upgrade will fork off the canonical chain at block 1000.
   - **Files:** `src/constants.rs` (`CHAIN_ID`, `REPLAY_PROTECTION_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT`), `src/consensus.rs` (`compute_signing_message`), `src/blockchain.rs` (block assembly eviction), `src/rpc/handler.rs` (v2 transaction creation)

7. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
   - Add hybrid signatures (Ed25519 + PQC)
   - 10-20 year timeline before quantum threat
   - Monitor NIST PQC standardization

7. **Quadratic Voting for Governance**
   - Reduce whale voting power
   - More democratic governance
   - Requires economic analysis

8. **Private Mempool / Commit-Reveal**
   - Reduce MEV/front-running
   - Add complexity, tradeoffs needed
   - Research threshold encryption schemes

---

## LIVE MAINNET ATTACK VECTORS (April 2026)

The following attack vectors were observed and exploited against the live mainnet network in April 2026.
All have been investigated, root-caused, and fixed. Fixes shipped in commits `89bd02d`–`2d842f6` plus the
inbound V4 context fix.

---

### AV-6 ✅ Pre-Handshake Deregistration Attack
**Status:** **FIXED** (commit `89bd02d`)

**Attack:** Adversary opens a TCP connection to a node and immediately closes it before sending the
handshake (`Version`/`Verack`). The disconnect event fires and `mark_inactive_on_disconnect()` is
called with the connecting IP. If that IP matches a registered masternode's address, the masternode
entry is marked inactive/removed.

**Root cause:** `server.rs` called `mark_inactive_on_disconnect` unconditionally on TCP close, without
checking whether the handshake had completed.

**Fix:** Added `handshake_done: bool` tracking per connection. `mark_inactive_on_disconnect` is now
gated: only called when `handshake_done = true`. Pre-handshake closes trigger a `WARN` but do not
touch the masternode registry.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
WARN ⚠️  47.82.240.104:34204 sent message before handshake - closing connection (not banning)
INFO 🔌 Peer 47.82.240.104:34204 disconnected
```

---

### AV-7 ✅ Genesis Isolation via Timeout
**Status:** **FIXED** (commit `12e4fb1`)

**Attack:** Older nodes that don't implement `GetGenesisHash` time out when queried. The node marks
every peer that times out as "incompatible" with a 300-second re-check ban. On a large network with
many older nodes, all peers become simultaneously marked incompatible → `get_compatible_peers()`
returns empty → sync coordinator and fork detection stall completely. The node effectively isolates
itself from the network.

**Root cause:** `verify_genesis_compatibility()` in `peer_connection_registry.rs` treated timeout, I/O
errors, and unexpected response types identically to an explicit hash mismatch, all leading to
`mark_incompatible`.

**Fix:** Only an explicit hash mismatch (received a valid `GenesisHashResponse` with a different hash)
marks a peer as incompatible. Timeout, I/O error, or unrecognized response type now returns `true`
(assume compatible) with a debug log. Peers are only isolated when their genesis hash is provably wrong.

---

### AV-8 ✅ Free-Tier Collateral Squatting via Gossip Migration
**Status:** **FIXED** (commit `12e4fb1`)

**Attack:** A paid-tier masternode (Tier 1/2/3) is registered with a specific collateral outpoint.
An adversary registers as Free-tier with the same IP but different collateral. Then, the adversary
sends a gossip `MasternodeAnnouncementV3` with a new IP and the paid-tier node's collateral outpoint.
Free-tier nodes allow gossip IP migration without proof, so the paid collateral gets "migrated" to the
attacker's chosen IP, ejecting the legitimate owner.

**Root cause:** `register_internal()` in `masternode_registry.rs` allowed Free-tier migration to
overwrite any existing holder of an outpoint, including paid-tier holders.

**Fix:** Added a check: if the current holder of a collateral outpoint is a paid tier (Tier 1/2/3),
Free-tier gossip migration is blocked. The attacker receives a `🛡️` warning log and the migration is
rejected. Only an on-chain `MasternodeReg` transaction can claim a paid-tier collateral.

---

### AV-9 ✅ Startup Squatter Eviction Race
**Status:** **FIXED** (commits `73275c7`, `99e3718`)

**Attack:** The local node starts up and attempts to register its collateral. If an attacker already
squatted the outpoint (e.g., by gossip before the node restarted), `register_masternode()` returns
`CollateralAlreadyLocked`. The original code logged an error and exited the registration path,
leaving the local node unregistered. The attacker's squatter entry remained, and the dashboard showed
"Node is not configured as a masternode."

**Root cause:** `main.rs` treated `CollateralAlreadyLocked` as fatal, not as "evict squatter and
proceed."

**Fix:** On `CollateralAlreadyLocked`, the startup path now:
1. Calls `find_holder_of_outpoint()` to identify the squatter's IP.
2. Calls `unregister(squatter_ip)` to evict it.
3. Re-runs `register_masternode()` (succeeds now that lock is released).
4. Runs the full post-registration setup: `lock_local_collateral()`, reward address registration,
   `set_local_masternode()`, `mark_reachable()`.

This ensures the local node is fully operational even after a cold-start squatter attack.

---

### AV-10 ✅ V4 Eviction Storm (Per-Outpoint Denial of Service)
**Status:** **FIXED** (commit `2d842f6`)

**Attack:** Adversaries with a valid V4 collateral proof for a target outpoint repeatedly send
`MasternodeAnnouncementV4` messages, evicting the current holder. Because `unregister()` clears the
`collateral_anchor` sled key, each eviction resets the outpoint to claimable, allowing the next
eviction cycle immediately. With three coordinated attacker IPs, 435 V4 eviction events were observed
in 2 seconds against a single collateral outpoint (`926b2fb0:0`).

**Root cause (Path 1):** In `handle_masternode_announcement()`, the UTXOManager lock conflict path
set `can_evict = true` unconditionally for Tier 1 (V4 proof), without any rate limiting.

**Root cause (Path 2):** The registry-only eviction path (no UTXOManager lock present) had the same
unconditional `can_evict = true`.

**Fix:**
- Added `V4_EVICTION_COOLDOWN_SECS = 60` per-outpoint cooldown map (`v4_eviction_cooldown()`).
- Both eviction paths now check: if a V4 eviction occurred within the last 60 seconds for this
  outpoint, reject and log a storm warning (rate-limited to once per 30s per outpoint).
- Rate-limited storm warning logs prevent log flooding under sustained attack.

---

### AV-11 ✅ V4 Eviction of Local Node
**Status:** **FIXED** (commit `2d842f6`)

**Attack:** The local node's own collateral outpoint is targeted by an attacker who obtains (or
forges) a V4 collateral proof. The V4 eviction path removes the local node from the masternode
registry. `get_local_masternode()` then returns `None`, causing all RPC calls that depend on it to
return error `-4` ("Node is not configured as a masternode"). The dashboard shows the node as
deregistered while it is still running, causing operators to believe the node is broken and potentially
restart or reconfigure it (which the attacker hopes will disrupt service further).

**Root cause:** Both V4 eviction paths lacked a guard against evicting the node's own IP.

**Fix:** Both eviction paths now check `is_local_node` (comparing the eviction candidate IP against
`context.node_masternode_address`). If the candidate is the local node, eviction is blocked and a
`WARN` is logged:
```
WARN 🛡️ [Inbound] Blocking V4 eviction attempt against local node by <attacker_ip>
```

### AV-12 ✅ Inbound V4 Announcement Missing UTXO Manager
**Status:** **FIXED** (server.rs explicit V4 handler)

**Attack:** A paid-tier node sends a `MasternodeAnnouncementV4` message to a peer inbound connection.
Because `server.rs` had no explicit case for `NetworkMessage::MasternodeAnnouncementV4`, the message
fell through to the `_ =>` fallback handler, which creates a `MessageContext::minimal()` without
`utxo_manager`. The announcement handler requires `utxo_manager` to verify and lock the collateral;
without it, the message is silently dropped with:
```
WARN ⚠️ [Inbound] Cannot verify collateral for <ip> — no UTXO manager available
```
This prevented legitimate V4 masternodes from registering on nodes they connected to inbound, leaving
them invisible to part of the network and ineligible for rewards from those nodes.

**Root cause:** `server.rs` explicitly handled `MasternodeAnnouncementV2` and `V3` with UTXO manager
wiring, but omitted `V4`. The fallback `_ =>` handler never sets `utxo_manager`.

**Fix:** Added an explicit `NetworkMessage::MasternodeAnnouncementV4` match arm in `server.rs`
(inbound message loop) that mirrors the V2/V3 handlers: normalises the address from the TCP peer
address, sets `context.utxo_manager` and `context.peer_manager`, and delegates to the unified
`MessageHandler`.

### AV-13 ✅ Finality Injection / Broadcast Amplification (AV38)
**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.36)

**Attack:** The attacker sends `TransactionFinalized` messages for transactions that the receiving node has never seen (not in its pending pool). Before the fix, the node would:
1. Accept the TX as valid (no pool membership check)
2. Call `process_transaction()` which broadcasts a `TimeVoteRequest` to all N validators (~49× amplification per injected TX)
3. Add the TX to the finalized pool regardless of content

With unique TXIDs on every injection, the bloom-filter dedup never fires, and the attacker could drive 30+ broadcast amplification events per second from a single connection.

**Root cause (Path 1):** The `TransactionFinalized` handler called `process_transaction()` for unknown TXs, which unconditionally broadcasts `TimeVoteRequest` to all validators.

**Root cause (Path 2):** No structural validation of the TX occurred before pool admission — a TX with 0 inputs and 0 outputs was accepted without error.

**Relay attribution complexity:** The attacker feeds honest relay nodes (e.g. the operator's own masternodes), which then forward the `TransactionFinalized` messages. Banning the direct sender would ban innocent relays and fragment the network. The two-tier threshold (see Fix below) distinguishes relays from originators.

**Fix:**
- **Null TX structural guard**: If the incoming TX has 0 inputs, 0 outputs, and no `special_data`, it is dropped immediately before any pool operation. A single `record_finality_injection()` call is made (relay-safe — no ban issued for a single occurrence).
- **Amplification eliminated**: For unknown TXs that pass structural validation, the handler now calls `tx_pool.add_pending()` directly instead of `process_transaction()`. This adds the TX to the pool without triggering any `TimeVoteRequest` broadcast.
- **Two-tier rate limiting**:
  - ≥ 5 injections / 30 s → `RateLimitPeer` (may be a relay)
  - ≥ 20 injections / 30 s → `BlockPeer` (clearly the originator)
- **Per-message rate limit**: `"tx_finalized"` entry in `rate_limiter.rs` caps at 20 messages / 10 s per peer before any processing occurs.

### AV-14 ✅ Zero-Value Null Transaction Mempool Flood (AV39)
**Status:** **FIXED** (v1.4.36)

**Attack:** The attacker submits transactions with 0 inputs, 0 outputs, no special data, and 0 fee. These "null TXs" cost nothing to produce, pass trivial serialization, and — before the fix — were accepted into the mempool where they would sit forever:
- They can never be mined into a block (no inputs to spend, no outputs to create)
- They consume mempool slots and force other nodes to process and relay them
- Combined with AV38, the attacker can inject them as already-finalized, causing different nodes to hold different finalized TX sets, which induces chain forks when blocks are produced

**Root cause:** `process_transaction()` in `consensus.rs` and the `TransactionBroadcast` handler in `server.rs` had no structural guard rejecting TXs with both 0 inputs and 0 outputs. Masternode registration/deregistration TXs legitimately have no inputs and no outputs (they carry all state in `special_data`), so a blanket "no inputs = reject" rule would break registration.

**Relay attribution:** Honest relay nodes forward null TXs they receive from the attacker before our fix propagates. Banning based on a single null TX would ban innocent relays. The fix uses a sliding-window threshold so that relays (which forward each TXID at most once, thanks to bloom-filter dedup) never hit the ban threshold, while the originator (sending many unique null TXs) does.

**Fix:**
- **Structural guard in `process_transaction()`**: Rejects any TX where `inputs.is_empty() && special_data.is_none()` OR `outputs.is_empty() && special_data.is_none()`. Masternode TXs are exempt because they always carry `special_data`.
- **Structural guard in `TransactionFinalized` handler**: Same check applied on arrival of `TransactionFinalized` messages, before any pool operation (addresses AV38+AV39 combined attack path).
- **Relay-safe error handling in `TransactionBroadcast` handler**: Null TX errors (`"no inputs"` / `"no outputs"`) silently call `record_null_tx_flood()` without recording a banlist violation. Only ≥ 3 null TXs / 60 s from the same peer triggers `BlockPeer`.
- **Fork-induction prevention**: By dropping null TXs before pool admission, all nodes maintain identical finalized TX sets, preventing the chain-split side effect.

- `src/consensus.rs` — `process_transaction()` structural guard (~line 3010)
- `src/network/server.rs` — `TransactionBroadcast` relay-safe null TX error handler
- `src/ai/attack_detector.rs` — `record_null_tx_flood()` relay-safe 3/60 s sliding-window detection
